1. **Parse Input Requirements**: Extract all functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Generate Architecture**: Create appropriate architecture based on requirements
3. **Populate Template**: Fill all sections systematically
4. **Create Diagrams**: Generate visual representations using ASCII art or markdown
5. **Validate Completeness**: Ensure all template sections are addressed
6. **Quality Check**: Review for consistency and technical accuracy
7. **Format Output**: Apply proper markdown formatting and structure

### Quality Standards:
- All requirements must be traceable to design components
- Technology choices must be justified
- Security considerations must be addressed
- Performance requirements must have corresponding design elements
- Deployment strategy must be practical and detailed

This template ensures comprehensive, consistent, and professional HLD documents that serve as effective blueprints for system implementation.
