## 2. Executive Summary

### 2.1 Purpose
This document provides the high-level design for a scalable Ride-Sharing Service, similar to Uber or Lyft. The system is designed to connect riders with nearby drivers, manage trip lifecycles, and handle payments.

### 2.2 Scope
**In Scope:**
- Rider and driver registration and profile management.
- Real-time location tracking of drivers.
- A matching service to connect riders with the most suitable drivers.
- Trip management (request, acceptance, start, end).
- Fare estimation and payment processing integration.
- A review and rating system for both riders and drivers.

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced features like scheduled rides, multi-stop trips, or carpooling (e.g., Uber Pool).
- In-app chat between rider and driver.
- Demand-based "surge" pricing algorithms (though the architecture will allow for it).
- Integrations with public transport or other mobility options.

### 2.3 Key Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Quickly matches riders with the nearest available drivers to minimize wait times.
- **Reliability**: Provides a reliable and safe transportation option with tracking and ratings.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle millions of users and trips in multiple geographic regions.
- **Flexibility**: The architecture supports the future addition of new features like different vehicle types or pricing models.

### 2.4 High-Level Architecture Overview
The architecture is a set of real-time, location-aware microservices. A **Location Service** continuously ingests and processes GPS data from drivers' phones. When a rider requests a trip, a **Matching Service** queries the Location Service to find nearby available drivers and offers the trip to them. A **Trip Service** manages the state of the trip from request to completion. Communication is a mix of REST APIs for state changes and a real-time protocol (like MQTT or WebSockets) for location updates. Data will be stored in a combination of relational and NoSQL databases to handle different access patterns.

## 3. System Overview

### 3.1 Business Context
Ride-sharing services have revolutionized urban transportation by providing a convenient, on-demand alternative to traditional taxis and public transport. The core business is a three-sided marketplace connecting riders, drivers, and the platform itself, all orchestrated in real-time.

### 3.2 System Purpose
The system's purpose is to efficiently match riders seeking transportation with available drivers. It must manage real-time location data, handle the lifecycle of a trip, calculate fares, and process payments, providing a seamless experience for both riders and drivers.

### 3.3 Success Criteria
- **Wait Time**: Average rider wait time should be < 5 minutes in covered areas.
- **Driver Utilization**: Maximize driver utilization to ensure a healthy supply side of the marketplace.
- **Scalability**: Support 1 million concurrent users (both riders and drivers) in a major metropolitan area.
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime for the trip booking and management services.

### 3.4 Assumptions
- Both riders and drivers have smartphones with GPS capabilities.
- A reliable third-party mapping and navigation service (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox) is available.
- A third-party payment gateway will be used for all transactions.

### 3.5 Constraints
- The system must handle a high volume of real-time location updates from thousands of drivers simultaneously.
- The matching algorithm must be fast and fair to both drivers and riders.
- Regulatory requirements may vary by city and must be accounted for.

### 3.6 Dependencies
- Mapping & Navigation Service (e.g., Google Maps API).
- Payment Gateway (e.g., Stripe, Braintree).
- SMS/Push Notification Service for user communication.

## 5. Architecture Design

### 5.1 Architecture Principles
- **Location-Aware**: The system is fundamentally designed around geospatial data.
- **Real-Time**: Matching and trip updates must happen with very low latency.
- **High Availability**: The system must be highly available, as downtime results in direct revenue loss and user dissatisfaction.
- **Scalability**: Services must scale independently to handle fluctuating demand in different geographic areas.

### 5.2 Architecture Patterns
- **Microservices**: The system is broken down into domain-specific services (Location, Matching, Trip, Payment, etc.).
- **Event-Driven**: The lifecycle of a trip is a series of events (e.g., `TRIP_REQUESTED`, `TRIP_ACCEPTED`, `TRIP_STARTED`, `TRIP_ENDED`) that trigger actions in different services.
- **Geospatial Indexing**: A specialized index (like a quadtree or S2) is used to enable efficient "find nearby drivers" queries.

### 5.4 Component Overview
- **Location Service**: Ingests a high volume of location updates from driver apps. It maintains the real-time position of all online drivers in a geospatial index for efficient querying.
- **Matching Service**: The core of the service. When a rider requests a trip, this service queries the Location Service to find a set of nearby, available drivers. It then runs an algorithm to select the best candidate(s) and offers them the trip.
- **Trip Service**: A state machine that manages the lifecycle of a trip from `REQUESTED` to `COMPLETED` or `CANCELLED`. It coordinates with other services (e.g., tells the Notification service to alert the driver, tells the Payment service to charge the rider).
- **Notification Service**: Sends real-time updates to riders and drivers via push notifications or SMS (e.g., "Your driver has arrived").
- **User Service**: Manages rider and driver profiles, authentication, and ratings.
- **Payment Service**: Integrates with a third-party payment gateway to handle all financial transactions.

### 5.5 Technology Stack
#### 5.5.1 Backend Technologies
- **Programming Language**: **Go** or **Java/Kotlin**.
  - **Justification**: Strong performance, concurrency features, and mature ecosystems suitable for building a complex set of microservices.
- **Real-Time Protocol**: **MQTT** or **WebSockets**.
  - **Justification**: MQTT is lightweight and designed for unreliable mobile networks, making it a great choice for sending frequent GPS updates from driver apps with minimal battery drain.

#### 5.5.2 Database Technologies
- **Geospatial Database**: **PostGIS** (an extension for PostgreSQL) or a specialized in-memory index built with libraries like **Google's S2**.
  - **Justification**: Essential for efficiently querying for drivers within a certain radius of a rider.
- **Trip/User Database**: **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**.
  - **Justification**: The transactional nature of trip and user data makes a relational database a good fit.
- **Service Communication**: **gRPC** for internal requests and a **Message Queue (Kafka)** for asynchronous events between services.

### 5.6 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
#### 5.6.1 ADR-001: Geospatial Indexing Strategy
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: The Matching Service needs to perform millions of "find nearby drivers" queries per day with very low latency. A naive database scan would be far too slow.
- **Decision**: We will use **Google's S2 library** for geospatial indexing. The world map will be divided into S2 cells. Drivers' locations will be mapped to a cell ID. To find nearby drivers, the Matching Service will query for drivers in the rider's cell and its neighboring cells. This significantly narrows down the search space.
- **Consequences**: This introduces a specialized library that the team must learn. The logic for handling cell coverage and different zoom levels adds complexity but is necessary for performance at scale. The mapping of drivers to cells can be stored in memory (e.g., in Redis) for even faster lookups.

## 7. Data Design

### 7.1 Data Models
- **User/Driver**: `user_id`, `name`, `rating`, `vehicle_info` (for drivers).
- **Trip**: `trip_id`, `rider_id`, `driver_id`, `pickup_location`, `destination`, `status`, `fare`, `created_at`.
- **Location**: A real-time record of `driver_id` and their current `(lat, lon)`.

### 7.2 Database Design
**Table: `trips` (PostgreSQL)**
- `trip_id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `rider_id` (BIGINT)
- `driver_id` (BIGINT)
- `status` (VARCHAR)
- `fare` (DECIMAL)
- `pickup_address` (TEXT)
- `dropoff_address` (TEXT)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- `completed_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)

**Geospatial Index (e.g., Redis with Geo commands)**
- A Redis Geo Set `drivers:locations`.
- `GEOADD drivers:locations <lon> <lat> <driver_id>`: To update a driver's location.
- `GEORADIUS drivers:locations <lon> <lat> 5 km`: To find all drivers within a 5km radius.

---

## 8. API Design

### 8.1 API Architecture
The system uses a combination of synchronous REST APIs for transactional operations and a real-time messaging protocol for location updates and notifications.

### 8.2 Core APIs (RESTful)
- `POST /api/v1/trips`: Rider requests a new trip.
- `GET /api/v1/trips/{trip_id}`: Get the current status of a trip.
- `POST /api/v1/trips/{trip_id}/accept`: Driver accepts a trip offer.
- `POST /api/v1/drivers/{driver_id}/location`: Driver updates their location (can also be done via MQTT).

---

## 9. Security Design

### 9.1 Security Architecture
The system will enforce strict boundaries between services and handle sensitive PII (location, user details) with care. All network traffic will be encrypted.

### 9.2 Authentication & Authorization
- **Rider/Driver Authentication**: Authentication will be handled by the User Service using standard OAuth 2.0 flows. Clients will receive a JWT access token.
- **Service Authentication**: Internal service-to-service communication will be secured with mTLS.

### 9.3 Data Security
- **Data at Rest**: All databases and object stores will have encryption at rest enabled.
- **Data in Transit**: All API calls (REST, gRPC) and real-time messages (MQTT) will be over a TLS-encrypted channel.
- **PII Handling**: Location data will be anonymized when not needed for an active trip. Access to user PII will be strictly logged and audited.

### 9.4 Application Security
- **Fraud Detection**: A separate service will analyze trip patterns to detect fraudulent activities, such as drivers and riders colluding to create fake trips.
- **Input Validation**: All API endpoints will validate inputs to prevent common vulnerabilities.

---

## 10. Scalability & Performance

### 10.1 Performance Requirements
- As defined in section 4.2.1. The most critical requirements are the latency of location updates and driver matching.

### 10.2 Scalability Strategy
- **Location Service**: This is the most write-heavy service. It can be scaled by sharding drivers based on their geographic region (S2 cell). Each shard can be a separate cluster of in-memory geospatial indexes.
- **Matching & Trip Services**: These services are transactional but can be scaled horizontally. The database backing them can be scaled with read replicas and, eventually, sharding by `city_id` or `user_id`.

---

## 11. Deployment & Operations

### 11.1 Deployment Architecture
- The system will be deployed on Kubernetes. A multi-cluster, multi-region setup will be used to serve different geographic markets and provide high availability.

### 11.2 Monitoring & Alerting
- **Key Business Metrics**: `avg_rider_wait_time`, `driver_utilization_rate`, `match_success_rate`, `trips_per_hour`.
- **Key System Metrics**: `location_update_rate`, `match_api_latency`, `trip_state_transition_errors`.
- **Tools**: Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards, Loki for logging, and PagerDuty for alerts.

---

## 12. Testing Strategy

### 12.1 Test Types
- **Unit & Integration Tests**: Standard tests for each microservice.
- **Simulation Testing**: This is critical. A simulation environment will be created to model thousands of virtual drivers and riders moving around a map of a city. This allows for testing the matching algorithm, location service scalability, and overall system stability under realistic load.
- **GPS Accuracy Testing**: Field testing with real devices to ensure GPS data is being handled correctly.

## 13. Risk Analysis

### 13.1 Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Inaccurate Matching | High | Medium | The matching algorithm fails to find the best driver. Continuously refine the algorithm. Use A/B testing to compare different matching strategies. |
| GPS Signal Loss | Medium | High | The driver or rider app loses GPS signal. The client app must have logic to handle this, and the backend must tolerate intermittent updates. |
| Payment Gateway Failure | High | Medium | Implement a circuit breaker and retry logic for the payment service. Have a reconciliation process for failed payments. |

### 13.2 Business Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Lack of Driver/Rider Supply | High | High | This is a "cold start" problem for the marketplace. Use incentives, marketing, and referral programs to build up both sides of the market. |
| Local Regulations | High | High | The service must be adaptable to different local regulations regarding licensing, pricing, and operation. |
