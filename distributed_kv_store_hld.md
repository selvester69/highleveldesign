## 2. Executive Summary

### 2.1 Purpose
This document provides the high-level design for a distributed key-value store. The system is engineered for high availability, reliability, and predictable performance at scale. It serves as a foundational database layer for applications requiring a flexible schema and horizontal scalability, drawing inspiration from systems like Amazon DynamoDB and Apache Cassandra.

### 2.2 Scope
**Included**:
- Persistent key-value (or wide-column) data storage.
- Partitioning (sharding) for horizontal scalability.
- High availability and durability via synchronous replication.
- Tunable consistency for read and write operations.
- A simple, high-performance API for data manipulation.

**Excluded**:
- Relational database features (e.g., joins, complex transactions).
- Full-text search capabilities.
- Ad-hoc querying and analytics.

### 2.3 Key Benefits
- **Scalability**: Seamlessly scales out to handle massive datasets and high request volumes.
- **Availability**: Designed with no single point of failure, providing high uptime.
- **Durability**: Data is replicated across multiple nodes and data centers to prevent loss.
- **Performance**: Provides low-latency, predictable performance for key-based lookups.

### 2.4 High-Level Architecture Overview
The system uses a peer-to-peer, decentralized architecture based on a consistent hashing ring for data distribution. Data is partitioned and replicated across multiple nodes. A coordinator node (which can be any node in the cluster) routes client requests to the appropriate replica nodes responsible for the data. The system uses a quorum-based protocol to ensure data consistency.

## 3. System Overview

### 3.1 Business Context
Modern applications, especially at internet-scale, require databases that can scale beyond a single server. Traditional relational databases often become bottlenecks. Distributed key-value stores address this need by providing a more flexible data model and a horizontally scalable architecture, suitable for a wide range of use cases including user profiles, product catalogs, and IoT data ingestion.

### 3.2 System Purpose
To provide a highly scalable and available database solution for applications that can model their data as key-value pairs or wide-column families. It is designed to be the authoritative system of record.

### 3.3 Success Criteria
- **Availability**: Achieve 99.999% uptime.
- **Durability**: Achieve 99.999999999% (11 9s) data durability.
- **Latency**: P99 latency of < 10ms for key lookups.
- **Scalability**: Scale to petabytes of data and millions of requests per second.

### 3.4 Assumptions
- The primary access pattern is key-based lookups.
- Clients can handle retries and are aware of the distributed nature of the system.
- The network is reliable, but partitions are inevitable and must be handled gracefully.

### 3.5 Constraints
- Single-key operations are the primary API.
- Transactions are limited to single-key or single-partition operations (e.g., using Paxos/Raft for linearizability).

### 3.6 Dependencies
- A robust physical infrastructure (multiple servers, racks, and data centers).
- Accurate time synchronization across nodes (e.g., using NTP).

## 5. Architecture Design

### 5.1 Architecture Principles
- **Symmetry**: All nodes are peers; no special master nodes.
- **Decentralization**: Promotes availability and avoids single points of failure.
- **Tunable Consistency**: Allow applications to choose the right trade-off between consistency, availability, and latency.
- **Durability First**: Data must not be lost.

### 5.2 Architecture Patterns
- **Consistent Hashing Ring**: For data distribution and partitioning.
- **Quorum Protocol**: For tunable consistency.
- **Gossip Protocol**: For failure detection and cluster membership.
- **Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree)**: For the storage engine, optimizing for high write throughput.

// Request Flow (Example: Write with Quorum)
1. Client sends write request to any node (Coordinator).
2. Coordinator uses the consistent hash ring to identify the N replicas for the key.
3. Coordinator sends the write to all N replicas.
4. Coordinator waits for acknowledgements from a quorum of replicas (W < N).
5. Coordinator returns success to the client.
```

### 5.4 Component Overview
- **Client Library**: Interacts with the cluster, can be partition-aware to route requests efficiently.
- **Coordinator Node**: Any node that receives a client request. It's responsible for routing the request to the correct replicas and gathering responses.
- **Replica Node**: A node that holds a copy of a data partition.
- **Storage Engine**: The component within each node responsible for persisting data to disk.
- **Gossip Protocol Layer**: Manages cluster membership and failure detection.

### 5.5 Technology Stack
#### 5.5.2 Backend Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Java or C++ are common choices due to mature ecosystems and performance.
- **Storage Engine**: Custom implementation of a Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree).

### 5.6 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
#### 5.6.1 ADR-001: Choice of Storage Engine
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: We need a storage engine optimized for the expected workload (heavy writes, fast key lookups).
- **Decision**: Use a Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree). It buffers writes in memory (MemTable) and flushes them sequentially to disk (SSTables), which is much faster than random writes required by B-Trees. Reads may be slightly slower as they might need to check multiple files.
- **Consequences**: Excellent write performance. Read performance is optimized via Bloom filters and compaction.

## 6. Detailed Component Design

### 6.1 Component 1: Storage Engine (LSM-Tree)
#### 6.1.1 Purpose
To efficiently write data to and read data from disk on each node.
#### 6.1.2 Responsibilities
- Accept writes and store them in an in-memory MemTable and a commit log.
- When the MemTable is full, flush it to a sorted, immutable disk file (SSTable).
- Perform compaction in the background to merge SSTables, purge deleted data, and improve read performance.
- Serve read requests by checking the MemTable first, then SSTables (using Bloom filters to avoid unnecessary disk I/O).

### 6.2 Component 2: Replication & Consistency Module
#### 6.2.1 Purpose
To manage data replication and handle consistency levels for read/write operations.
#### 6.2.2 Responsibilities
- For a given request, determine the set of N replica nodes.
- Enforce the requested consistency level (e.g., wait for W/R acknowledgements).
- Handle hinted handoff for when a replica is temporarily unavailable.
- Initiate read repairs when a read request detects inconsistencies between replicas.

## 7. Data Design

### 7.1 Data Architecture
Data is modeled as a collection of tables. Each table has a Primary Key that uniquely identifies each item.

### 7.2 Data Models
- **Primary Key**: Can be a simple **Partition Key** or a composite key of a **Partition Key** and a **Sort Key**.
  - **Partition Key**: Determines the partition (and thus the node) where the data is stored.
  - **Sort Key**: Orders items within the same partition.

### 7.3 Database Design
- **Data Storage Strategy**: Data is stored on local disks (SSD recommended) managed by the LSM-Tree storage engine. Each write is also appended to a commit log for durability.

### 7.4 Data Flow Diagrams
- **Write Path**: Client -> Coordinator -> Replicas -> Commit Log & MemTable -> (async) SSTable flush.
- **Read Path**: Client -> Coordinator -> Replicas -> Read from MemTable & SSTables -> Coordinator merges results (if necessary) -> Client.

## 8. API Design

### 8.1 API Architecture
Typically a binary protocol over TCP for performance, with HTTP/JSON wrappers available.

### 8.2 API Specifications
- **`PutItem(TableName, Item, [ConsistencyLevel])`**
- **`GetItem(TableName, Key, [ConsistencyLevel])`**
- **`DeleteItem(TableName, Key, [ConsistencyLevel])`**
- **`Query(TableName, PartitionKey, [SortKeyCondition], [ConsistencyLevel])`**: Retrieve a range of items within a partition.

---

## 9. Security Design

### 9.1 Security Architecture
A zero-trust model where all requests must be authenticated and authorized.

### 9.2 Authentication & Authorization
- **Authentication**: Use cryptographic signatures (e.g., AWS SigV4) to authenticate requests.
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained access control policies (IAM) attached to users/roles that specify allowed actions on specific resources (tables).

### 9.3 Data Security
- **Encryption in transit**: Mandatory TLS for all communication.
- **Encryption at rest**: All data on disk is encrypted using a standard like AES-256.

---

## 10. Scalability & Performance

### 10.1 Scalability Strategy
#### 10.2.1 Horizontal Scaling
- New nodes can be added to the cluster. They will be assigned ranges in the consistent hashing ring and data will be streamed to them from existing replicas without downtime.

### 10.2 Anti-Entropy & Repair
- **Anti-Entropy**: A background process (e.g., using Merkle Trees) that continuously compares replicas and repairs any inconsistencies.
- **Read Repair**: Inconsistencies detected during a read operation are repaired on-the-fly.

---

## 11. Deployment & Operations

### 11.1 Deployment Architecture
Deployed across multiple availability zones (AZs) or geographic regions to ensure high availability and disaster recovery. The replication factor should be chosen to tolerate AZ failures (e.g., N=3).

### 11.2 CI/CD Pipeline
- Rigorous testing pipeline including unit, integration, and large-scale distributed correctness tests (e.g., using Jepsen).

### 11.3 Monitoring & Alerting
- **Key Metrics**: Read/write latency (per-partition), throughput, disk usage, partition health, replication lag.
- Alerting on high latency, low disk space, and node failures.

---

## 12. Testing Strategy

### 12.1 Test Types
- **Unit Testing**: For individual components like the LSM-Tree implementation.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing node-to-node communication, replication, and quorum logic.
- **System Testing**: Large-scale, long-running tests that inject faults (node crashes, network partitions) to verify correctness and resilience (e.g., Jepsen testing).
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmarking read/write performance under different load conditions and consistency levels.

## 13. Risk Analysis

### 13.1 Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Clock Skew | High | Medium | Use NTP for time synchronization. Design protocols to be tolerant of small clock drift. Use vector clocks for causality tracking. |
| Correlated Failures | High | Low | Distribute replicas across different racks and availability zones. |
| Hot Partitions | High | Medium | Design schemas with high-cardinality partition keys. Implement adaptive partitioning if necessary. |
