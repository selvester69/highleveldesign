## 2. Executive Summary

### 2.1 Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive high-level design for a URL Shortener service. The system is designed to convert long URLs into short, manageable links and redirect users from the short link to the original URL.

### 2.2 Scope
**In Scope:**
- Shortening of long URLs.
- Redirection from short URLs to the original destination.
- Generation of unique, non-sequential short links.
- Basic analytics on link usage (e.g., click count).
- REST APIs for creating and managing links.

**Out of Scope:**
- User accounts and authentication (initially).
- Advanced analytics dashboards.
- Custom vanity URLs for non-authenticated users.
- Link expiration settings.

### 2.3 Key Benefits
- **Simplicity**: Provides easy-to-share, clean links.
- **Efficiency**: Fast redirection to the target URL.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a high volume of links and traffic.
- **Trackability**: Allows for basic tracking of link engagement.

### 2.4 High-Level Architecture Overview
The proposed architecture is a distributed system consisting of a stateless application layer, a scalable NoSQL database for URL mapping, and a caching layer to ensure low-latency redirections. The system will be designed with microservices principles to ensure scalability and maintainability, with separate services for link creation and redirection. A load balancer will distribute incoming traffic to ensure high availability and performance.

---

## 3. System Overview

### 3.1 Business Context
In a digital world saturated with information, sharing long and cumbersome URLs is inefficient and user-unfriendly. A URL shortener provides a simple solution by converting these long links into short, memorable, and easily shareable versions, improving the user experience on social media, messaging apps, and other platforms.

### 3.2 System Purpose
The primary purpose of this system is to provide a highly available and scalable service for shortening URLs and redirecting users. It aims to deliver fast redirection times and provide basic analytics on link usage to understand engagement.

### 3.3 Success Criteria
- **High Availability**: 99.9% uptime for the redirection service.
- **Low Latency**: 99th percentile redirection latency of < 50ms.
- **Scalability**: The system should handle 100 million new URLs per month and 1 billion redirections per month.
- **Correctness**: Every valid short URL correctly redirects to its original long URL.

### 3.4 Assumptions
- The traffic for URL creation will be significantly lower than for URL redirection (e.g., 1:100 ratio).
- The average length of a long URL is 100 characters.
- Users will tolerate a slightly higher latency for URL creation compared to redirection.
- The character set for short URLs is `[a-zA-Z0-9]`, which contains 62 characters.

### 3.5 Constraints
- Short URLs must be unique and non-guessable to prevent trivial enumeration.
- The length of the short URL should be minimal (e.g., 7-8 characters) to be effective.
- The system must be cost-effective to operate at scale.

### 3.6 Dependencies
- The system depends on a cloud infrastructure provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) for hosting, database services, and other managed resources.

## 4. Requirements Analysis

### 4.1 Functional Requirements
#### 4.1.1 Core Features
- **FR-001**: The system shall accept a long URL and return a unique, shorter URL.
- **FR-002**: When a user accesses a short URL, the system shall redirect them to the original long URL using a 301 (permanent) redirect.
- **FR-003**: The system shall track the number of times a short URL is accessed (clicked).
- **FR-004**: The short URL generation should not be predictable.

#### 4.1.2 User Stories
- As a content creator, I want to shorten a long URL so that I can share it easily on platforms with character limits (like Twitter).
- As a user, I want to click on a short link and be quickly redirected to the correct destination page.
- As a marketer, I want to know how many people clicked on my shortened link so that I can measure my campaign's reach.

### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements
#### 4.2.1 Performance Requirements
- **Response time (Redirection)**: < 50ms at the 99th percentile.
- **Response time (Creation)**: < 200ms at the 99th percentile.
- **Throughput (Redirection)**: Able to handle at least 500 redirections per second at peak.
- **Throughput (Creation)**: Able to handle at least 5 new URLs per second at peak.

#### 4.2.2 Scalability Requirements
- The system must be able to scale horizontally to accommodate traffic growth.
- The data store must support billions of URL entries.
- The system should be designed to handle a 10x increase in traffic over two years.

#### 4.2.3 Availability Requirements
- **Uptime**: 99.9% for the redirection service. The creation service can have a slightly lower uptime of 99.5%.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 15 minutes in case of a regional outage.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 1 hour. Data loss should be minimized.

#### 4.2.4 Security Requirements
- The system must be protected against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10), such as SQL injection and XSS.
- The system should have rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., creating too many URLs from a single IP).
- Redirection should not expose the system to open redirect vulnerabilities. The system must validate that the long URL is a valid URL format.

#### 4.2.5 Usability Requirements
- The API for creating short URLs should be simple and easy to use for developers.
- The user interface (if any) should be intuitive.

#### 4.2.6 Reliability Requirements
- The mapping between a short URL and a long URL must be permanent and never change.
- The click counting mechanism should be highly reliable but can tolerate eventual consistency.

## 5. Architecture Design

### 5.1 Architecture Principles
- **Design for Failure**: The system is distributed and must be resilient to component failures.
- **Scalability**: All components must be able to scale horizontally and independently.
- **Loose Coupling**: Components should be loosely coupled to allow for independent development, deployment, and scaling.
- **High Performance**: The redirection path must be highly optimized for low latency.
- **Security First**: Security is a primary consideration in the design of all components and APIs.

### 5.2 Architecture Patterns
- **Microservices**: The system is broken down into smaller, independent services (e.g., URL Shortening Service, Redirection Service).
- **Asynchronous Communication**: For non-critical operations like analytics, an event-driven approach using a message queue will be used to decouple services and improve resilience.
- **Database per Service**: Each microservice will own its data and schema to ensure loose coupling.

### 5.4 Component Overview
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers to ensure high availability and reliability.
- **Web Servers (API Gateway)**: A set of stateless servers that handle incoming HTTP requests. They act as a gateway, routing requests to the appropriate backend service.
- **URL Shortening Service**: Handles the creation of new short URLs. It takes a long URL, generates a unique short code via the Unique ID Generation Service, and stores the mapping in the database.
- **Unique ID Generation Service**: A dedicated service responsible for generating unique, 62-bit IDs that are then base62-encoded to create the short URL. This prevents collisions and contention on a single database sequence.
- **Redirection Service**: Handles incoming short URL requests. It first checks the cache for the long URL. If not found (cache miss), it retrieves it from the database, caches it, and then redirects the user.
- **Cache**: A distributed in-memory cache (like Redis or Memcached) to store mappings of popular or recent short URLs to their long URLs, significantly reducing redirection latency.
- **Database**: A highly scalable NoSQL database (like Cassandra or DynamoDB) to store the primary mapping of short URLs to long URLs. The short URL (or its hash) serves as the partition key for efficient lookups.
- **Message Queue**: An asynchronous messaging system (like Kafka or RabbitMQ) to decouple the click tracking from the redirection path. The Redirection Service publishes a "URL clicked" event to the queue.
- **Analytics Service**: A consumer service that reads from the message queue, aggregates click data, and stores it in a separate analytics database.

### 5.5 Technology Stack
#### 5.5.1 Frontend Technologies
- **Not Applicable**: The core service is API-based. A simple HTML/JS/CSS frontend could be added for demonstration, but is not part of the core design.

#### 5.5.2 Backend Technologies
- **Programming Language**: **Go**
  - **Justification**: Excellent for high-performance, concurrent applications like a URL shortener. Its speed and low memory footprint make it ideal for the high-throughput redirection service.
- **Framework**: Standard library `net/http` for simple services, potentially a lightweight framework like Gin for more complex routing.
  - **Justification**: The standard library is often sufficient and highly performant. Gin adds useful features without significant overhead.

#### 5.5.3 Database Technologies
- **Primary Database**: **Apache Cassandra** or **Amazon DynamoDB**
  - **Justification**: These NoSQL databases offer excellent write throughput and horizontal scalability, which is perfect for storing billions of URLs. The key-value nature of the data (short_url -> long_url) is a natural fit for their data models.
- **Caching**: **Redis**
  - **Justification**: Redis is an extremely fast in-memory key-value store, perfect for caching. Its performance is critical for meeting the low-latency redirection requirement.

#### 5.5.4 Infrastructure & DevOps
- **Cloud Platform**: **AWS**
  - **Justification**: Provides managed services for all required components (DynamoDB, ElastiCache for Redis, Lambda, EKS, SQS/Kinesis) which simplifies deployment and operations.
- **Containerization**: **Docker**
  - **Justification**: Standard for packaging applications and their dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments.
- **Orchestration**: **Kubernetes (AWS EKS)**
  - **Justification**: Provides robust orchestration for managing, scaling, and deploying containerized applications.
- **CI/CD**: **Jenkins / GitLab CI / AWS CodePipeline**
  - **Justification**: To automate the build, testing, and deployment pipeline, enabling rapid and reliable releases.

### 5.6 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
#### 5.6.1 ADR-001: Choice of Unique ID Generation Strategy
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: The system needs to generate a unique, short, and non-sequential string for each URL. A simple auto-incrementing integer from a relational database would be a bottleneck and predictable.
- **Decision**: We will use a dedicated ID generation service based on a distributed unique ID generator like **Snowflake** (by Twitter) or a custom implementation using a range-based allocation from a central counter (e.g., ZooKeeper). Each ID is a 64-bit integer, which is then **base62-encoded** (`[a-zA-Z0-9]`) to create a short, clean URL string. This approach is highly scalable and generates non-sequential IDs.
- **Consequences**: This adds a new service to maintain, but it decouples a critical function and removes a major scalability bottleneck from the database. The generated IDs are not guaranteed to be monotonically increasing, which is acceptable for this use case.

## 7. Data Design

### 7.1 Data Architecture
The data architecture is split between a primary transactional database optimized for fast key-value lookups and a separate analytics database optimized for aggregation and reporting.

### 7.2 Data Models
#### 7.2.1 Conceptual Data Model
- An **URL Mapping** entity exists that links a `short_code` to a `long_url` and contains metadata like `creation_timestamp`.
- An **Analytics Event** entity exists that captures each `click` event with details like `short_code`, `timestamp`, and `user_agent`.

### 7.3 Database Design
#### 7.3.1 Database Schema (Cassandra/DynamoDB)
**Table: `url_mappings`**
- `short_code` (string, Partition Key): The base62-encoded unique ID.
- `long_url` (string): The original URL.
- `created_at` (timestamp): The creation time of the mapping.
- `metadata` (map/json): Optional field for other data.

**Table: `click_events` (Analytics DB, e.g., ClickHouse/Druid)**
- `event_id` (uuid): Unique ID for the event.
- `short_code` (string): The clicked short code.
- `timestamp` (datetime): Time of the click.
- `ip_address` (string): IP address of the user.
- `user_agent` (string): User agent of the client.
- `geo_location` (string): Geo-location derived from IP.

#### 7.3.2 Data Storage Strategy
- **Primary storage**: The `url_mappings` table will be stored in Cassandra/DynamoDB, partitioned by `short_code` for O(1) lookups. Data size is estimated: 1 billion URLs * (8 bytes for short_code + 100 bytes for long_url) ~= 108 GB. With replication, this would be ~324 GB.
- **Caching strategy**: A write-through or write-around caching strategy will be used. Given the read-heavy nature, a read-through (lazy loading) approach is most practical. The cache will store the most frequently accessed `short_code:long_url` pairs. Cache eviction policy will be LRU (Least Recently Used).
- **Backup strategy**: Point-in-time recovery backups for the primary database will be taken daily, with continuous backups enabled if the cloud provider supports it (like DynamoDB).

### 7.4 Data Flow Diagrams
The component interaction diagrams above illustrate the primary data flows for read and write paths.

### 7.5 Data Security & Privacy
- **Encryption at rest**: All data stored in the database and cache will be encrypted at rest.
- **Encryption in transit**: All data communication between services will be over TLS.
- **Data classification**: `long_url` can contain PII. It will be treated as sensitive.
- **Privacy compliance**: IP addresses in the analytics database will be anonymized or aggregated to comply with privacy regulations like GDPR.

## 8. API Design

### 8.1 API Architecture
A simple RESTful API will be exposed for creating and managing URLs.

### 8.2 API Specifications
#### 8.2.1 Authentication & Authorization
- For the initial public version, no authentication is required.
- To prevent abuse, rate limiting will be strictly enforced on a per-IP basis for the creation endpoint.
- Future versions could introduce API keys for authenticated users with higher rate limits.

#### 8.2.2 Core APIs
##### API Endpoint 1: Create Short URL
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Path**: `/api/v1/shorten`
- **Purpose**: To create a new short URL.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "url": "https://example.com/very/long/url/to/be/shortened"
  }
  ```
- **Response (Success - 201 Created)**:
  ```json
  {
    "short_url": "http://short.is/aB3xZ9c"
  }
  ```
- **Error Codes**:
  - `400 Bad Request`: If the request body is invalid or the `url` field is missing or malformed.
  - `429 Too Many Requests`: If the client exceeds the rate limit.

##### API Endpoint 2: Redirect to Long URL
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Path**: `/{short_code}`
- **Purpose**: To redirect the user to the original URL.
- **Request**: No request body. `short_code` is in the URL path.
- **Response**:
  - **Success**: `301 Permanent Redirect` with the `Location` header set to the long URL.
  - **Error**: `404 Not Found`: If the `short_code` does not exist.

### 8.3 API Documentation Strategy
API documentation will be generated and maintained using the **OpenAPI (Swagger)** specification. This provides an interactive way for developers to explore and test the API.

### 8.4 API Versioning Strategy
The API will be versioned in the URL path (e.g., `/api/v1/`). This ensures that future changes to the API do not break existing client integrations.

---

## 9. Security Design

### 9.1 Security Architecture
The security architecture is based on a defense-in-depth strategy, with security controls at the network, infrastructure, and application layers.

### 9.2 Authentication & Authorization
#### 9.2.1 User Authentication
- Not applicable for the initial public version.
#### 9.2.2 Service Authentication
- Service-to-service communication within the cluster will be secured using mutual TLS (mTLS) to ensure that only trusted services can communicate with each other.
#### 9.2.3 Authorization Model
- The API Gateway will enforce authorization rules. Initially, this will be limited to rate limiting based on IP address. Future versions with user accounts would use role-based access control (RBAC).

### 9.3 Data Security
- **Encryption standards**: TLS 1.2+ for data in transit. AES-256 for data at rest.
- **Key management**: Cloud provider's key management service (e.g., AWS KMS) will be used to manage encryption keys.
- **Data classification**: Long URLs are considered sensitive as they might contain PII. They will be logged with caution.

### 9.4 Network Security
- **Network segmentation**: The application will be deployed in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Public subnets will be used for the load balancer, while application servers and databases will be in private subnets with no direct internet access.
- **Firewall rules**: Security groups will be configured to only allow necessary traffic between components (e.g., only the Redirection Service can access the Redis cache).

### 9.5 Application Security
- **Input validation**: The API gateway and services will validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks. URLs will be validated to ensure they are well-formed.
- **Open Redirect Prevention**: The system will validate that the provided long URL belongs to a safe list of protocols (http, https) to prevent abuse.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented at the API Gateway to prevent DoS attacks and brute-force attempts.

### 9.6 Compliance & Governance
- The system will be designed to be compliant with GDPR and CCPA, particularly regarding the handling and anonymization of user data like IP addresses.

## 10. Scalability & Performance

### 10.1 Performance Requirements
- As defined in section 4.2.1, with a key focus on <50ms redirection latency.

### 10.2 Scalability Strategy
#### 10.2.1 Horizontal Scaling
- All service components (API Gateway, Shortening Service, Redirection Service) are stateless and will be deployed in containers managed by Kubernetes. They can be scaled horizontally by increasing the number of container replicas.
- The database (Cassandra/DynamoDB) and cache (Redis Cluster) are designed for horizontal scaling by adding more nodes to the cluster.
#### 10.2.2 Vertical Scaling
- Vertical scaling (increasing CPU/memory of nodes) can be used as a short-term solution but horizontal scaling is the primary strategy.

### 10.3 Caching Strategy
- A multi-layer caching approach will be used:
  - **CDN Caching**: A CDN can cache redirects for extremely popular links for a short TTL, reducing load on the origin.
  - **Application-level caching**: A distributed Redis cluster will cache `short_code:long_url` pairs.
  - **Cache Size**: The cache size will be provisioned to hold at least 20% of the daily active links, which should cover the vast majority of requests.

### 10.4 Load Balancing
- An Application Load Balancer (ALB) will distribute traffic. It will use a round-robin or least-connections algorithm to balance load across the stateless web servers.

### 10.5 Performance Monitoring
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** (or Datadog/New Relic) will be used to monitor latency, throughput, and error rates for all services.

### 10.6 Capacity Planning
- Capacity will be planned based on the non-functional requirements (1 billion redirections/month). Load testing will be performed to determine the exact resource requirements per node, and auto-scaling rules will be configured to add capacity based on CPU/memory utilization or request count.

## 11. Deployment & Operations

### 11.1 Deployment Architecture
- The system will be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., AWS EKS). Each microservice will be a separate deployment.

### 11.2 Environment Strategy
- **Development**: Local development using Docker Compose to spin up the required services.
- **Testing**: A dedicated testing environment that mirrors production, used for integration and performance testing.
- **Staging**: A pre-production environment for final validation before a release.
- **Production**: The live environment, with multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployment for high availability.

### 11.3 CI/CD Pipeline
- A pipeline will be set up using Jenkins or GitLab CI:
  1. **Commit**: Developer pushes code to a feature branch.
  2. **Build & Test**: The CI server builds a Docker image and runs unit/integration tests.
  3. **Deploy to Dev/Test**: On successful tests, the image is deployed to the testing environment.
  4. **Deploy to Staging**: After manual or automated approval, the change is promoted to staging.
  5. **Deploy to Production**: After final sign-off, a blue-green or canary deployment strategy will be used to release to production with zero downtime.

### 11.4 Monitoring & Alerting
- **Application Monitoring**: APM tools will track application health.
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: CloudWatch or Prometheus will monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network I/O of the infrastructure.
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty or Opsgenie will be integrated to send alerts for critical issues (e.g., latency spikes, 5xx error rate increase, service unavailability).

### 11.5 Logging Strategy
- **Log Aggregation**: Logs from all services will be shipped to a central logging platform like the **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or **Loki**.
- **Log Levels**: Services will use standard log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR).
- **Log Retention**: Logs will be retained for 30 days in the active logging system and archived for 1 year in cheaper storage (e.g., S3).

### 11.6 Disaster Recovery
- **Backup strategies**: Daily automated snapshots of the databases.
- **Recovery procedures**: The infrastructure will be defined using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform). In case of a full regional failure, the environment can be recreated in a different region from backups.
- **RTO/RPO targets**: RTO < 15 mins, RPO < 1 hour.

---

## 12. Testing Strategy

### 12.1 Testing Approach
- The testing strategy follows the testing pyramid, with a large base of unit tests, fewer integration tests, and a small number of end-to-end tests.

### 12.2 Test Types
- **Unit Testing**: Each service will have comprehensive unit tests with >80% code coverage.
- **Integration Testing**: Tests will verify the interaction between services (e.g., does the Shortening service correctly call the Database?).
- **System Testing (E2E)**: Automated tests that simulate user behavior (creating a short URL, then trying to access it).
- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing using tools like `k6` or `JMeter` to ensure the system meets its NFRs.
- **Security Testing**: Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.

## 13. Risk Analysis

### 13.1 Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Unique ID service becomes a bottleneck | High | Medium | Use a proven distributed ID generator. Implement client-side batching and pre-fetching of IDs. |
| Database write contention | High | Low | Use a highly scalable NoSQL DB like Cassandra. The random nature of short codes ensures writes are distributed across partitions. |
| Cache stampede on popular new link | Medium | Medium | Use a mechanism like a promise/future to ensure only one request populates the cache for a given key. |

### 13.2 Security Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Malicious actors using the service for phishing | High | High | Implement a blocklist for known malicious domains. Provide a mechanism to report and disable abusive links. |
| DoS/DDoS attack | High | Medium | Use a CDN and cloud provider's DDoS protection services. Implement strict rate limiting. |
