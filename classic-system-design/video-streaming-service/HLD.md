## 2. Executive Summary

### 2.1 Purpose

This document provides the high-level design for a scalable Video Streaming Service, similar to Netflix or YouTube. The system is designed to handle video uploads, processing (transcoding), and on-demand streaming to millions of users globally.

### 2.2 Scope

**In Scope:**

- Video uploading by content creators.
- An asynchronous video processing pipeline (transcoding, thumbnail generation).
- Storing and managing a large catalog of video content.
- Streaming video content to clients using adaptive bitrate technology.
- Global content delivery using a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
- Core user features like browsing and searching for videos.

**Out of Scope:**

- Live streaming.
- User-generated content like comments or ratings.
- Advanced features like Digital Rights Management (DRM), server-side ad insertion, or personalized recommendations.
- Content creator monetization and analytics.

### 2.3 Key Benefits

- **Scalability**: Designed to handle petabytes of video data and millions of concurrent streams.
- **Performance**: Provides fast video start times and minimal buffering through adaptive bitrate streaming and a CDN.
- **Reliability**: A fault-tolerant video processing pipeline ensures that uploaded videos are processed successfully.
- **Global Reach**: A CDN-based delivery model ensures a high-quality viewing experience for users anywhere in the world.

### 2.4 High-Level Architecture Overview

The architecture is divided into two main workflows: the **Video Processing Pipeline** and the **Streaming Workflow**. The pipeline is an asynchronous, event-driven system where an uploaded video is placed in an object store, triggering a series of processing jobs (e.g., transcoding into multiple resolutions, generating thumbnails). The results are stored in a second object store. The Streaming Workflow begins when a user requests a video. A **Streaming Service** provides the client with a manifest file, and the client then fetches the appropriate video segments directly from a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**, which caches the video data from the object store. This offloads the high-bandwidth task of video delivery from the core application servers.

## 3. System Overview

### 3.1 Business Context

Video streaming is a dominant form of internet traffic, with users expecting high-quality, instant-on video playback on a wide variety of devices and network conditions. A successful service requires a sophisticated backend pipeline for video processing and a robust, global delivery infrastructure.

### 3.2 System Purpose

The system's purpose is to provide a platform for content creators to upload videos and for users to stream them on demand. The system will handle all aspects of video processing, storage, and delivery to ensure a smooth playback experience.

### 3.3 Success Criteria

- **Video Start Time**: 95th percentile video start time of < 2 seconds.
- **Rebuffering Rate**: Less than 1% of streaming sessions should experience a rebuffering event.
- **Processing Time**: 99% of uploaded videos should be processed and available for streaming within 1 hour of upload.
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime for the streaming service.

### 3.4 Assumptions

- A global Content Delivery Network (CDN) is available and will be used.
- Users have clients capable of adaptive bitrate streaming (e.g., HLS, DASH).
- The cost of storage and bandwidth are the primary operational cost drivers.

### 3.5 Constraints

- The system must support a wide variety of input video formats.
- The video processing pipeline is computationally expensive and must be designed for cost-efficiency and parallelism.
- The system must be able to serve millions of concurrent streams.

### 3.6 Dependencies

- A global CDN provider (e.g., Akamai, Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront).
- A large-scale, durable object storage service (e.g., AWS S3).
- A distributed message queue for the processing pipeline.

## 4. Requirements Analysis

### 4.1 Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Users must be able to upload video files.
- **FR-002**: The system must process uploaded videos into multiple formats and resolutions (transcoding).
- **FR-003**: The system must generate thumbnails for videos.
- **FR-004**: The system must store and manage video metadata (e.g., title, description).
- **FR-005**: Users must be able to browse and search for videos.
- **FR-006**: The system must stream video to clients using an adaptive bitrate protocol.

### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements

#### 4.2.1 Performance Requirements

- **Video Playback Latency**: Time-to-first-frame should be < 2 seconds.
- **Seek/Scrub Latency**: Seeking to a new position in the video should be nearly instantaneous.
- **Upload Throughput**: The system must support hundreds of concurrent video uploads.

#### 4.2.2 Scalability Requirements

- The storage system must scale to hold petabytes of video data.
- The transcoding service must be able to scale out to process thousands of videos in parallel.
- The streaming infrastructure (CDN) must handle millions of concurrent requests.

#### 4.2.3 Availability Requirements

- The video playback path (CDN delivery) must have 99.99% availability.
- The video upload and processing path can have a lower availability of 99.9%.

#### 4.2.4 Security Requirements

- All video content should be protected from unauthorized access or download (e.g., using signed URLs).
- The upload process must be secure to prevent malicious file uploads.

---

## 5. Architecture Design

### 5.1 Architecture Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: The video processing (write path) is completely separate from the video streaming (read path).
- **Asynchronous Processing**: The transcoding pipeline is event-driven and asynchronous, allowing for scalability and resilience.
- **Offload to CDN**: The high-bandwidth task of delivering video segments is offloaded entirely to a global CDN.
- **Stateless Services**: All core application services (except for the processing workers) are stateless, allowing for easy scaling.

### 5.2 Architecture Patterns

- **Event-Driven Pipeline**: An S3 upload event triggers a message in a queue, which kicks off the entire transcoding workflow.
- **Fan-out/Fan-in**: A single upload event fans out into multiple parallel transcoding jobs (for different resolutions), which then fan back in to a single "processing complete" event.

### 5.4 Component Overview

- **Raw Video Storage**: An S3 bucket where original, high-quality video files are uploaded.
- **Message Queue**: A queue (like AWS SQS) that receives notifications when a new video is uploaded.
- **Video Processing Service**: A pool of worker nodes (e.g., EC2 instances or Lambda functions) that consume jobs from the queue. They use tools like **FFmpeg** to transcode the video into multiple resolutions and bitrates (e.g., 1080p, 720p, 480p).
- **Processed Video Storage**: A separate S3 bucket that stores the transcoded video segments, manifest files (HLS/DASH), and thumbnails. This bucket is configured as the origin for the CDN.
- **Metadata DB**: A database (e.g., PostgreSQL) that stores metadata about the videos, such as title, description, and the S3 path to the manifest file.
- **Streaming Service**: A lightweight service that handles user requests for video. It authenticates the user, checks their permissions, and then provides them with a signed URL to the video manifest file on the CDN.
- **CDN**: A global Content Delivery Network that caches the video segments and manifest files, delivering them to users from an edge location close to them.

### 5.5 Technology Stack

#### 5.5.1 Backend Technologies

- **Programming Language**: **Python** (for scripting the processing pipeline) and **Go** (for the high-performance streaming service).
- **Video Processing**: **FFmpeg** is the industry standard open-source tool for video transcoding.

#### 5.5.2 Database Technologies

- **Metadata Database**: **PostgreSQL**. Its relational nature is well-suited for storing structured video metadata.
- **Storage**: **Amazon S3** for both raw and processed video, due to its durability, scalability, and integration with other AWS services.
- **CDN**: **Amazon CloudFront** or another global CDN provider.

### 5.6 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

#### 5.6.1 ADR-001: Streaming Protocol

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: We need a streaming protocol that works on all modern devices and can adapt to changing network conditions to minimize buffering.
- **Decision**: We will use **HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)** as the primary delivery protocol. HLS is an adaptive bitrate streaming protocol developed by Apple and has wide support across browsers and mobile devices. It works by breaking the video into small HTTP-based file segments, which can be served from any standard web server or CDN.
- **Consequences**: The video processing pipeline must be designed to generate HLS-compatible segments (.ts files) and manifest files (.m3u8). This is a standard feature of tools like FFmpeg.

---

## 6. Detailed Component Design

### 6.1 Component 1: Video Processing Service

#### 6.1.1 Purpose

To orchestrate the transcoding of raw video files into various formats and bitrates.

#### 6.1.2 Responsibilities

- Consume a "video uploaded" event from the message queue.
- Spin up multiple parallel jobs to transcode the video into different resolutions (e.g., 1080p, 720p, 480p).
- Generate HLS/DASH manifest files.
- Generate thumbnails.
- Store all output artifacts in the Processed Video Storage bucket.
- Update the Metadata DB with the status and location of the processed files.

#### 6.1.3 Internal Design

- This can be implemented as a serverless workflow (e.g., AWS Step Functions) that coordinates multiple Lambda functions, each responsible for one transcoding task. This is highly scalable and cost-effective.

### 6.2 Component 2: Streaming Service

#### 6.2.1 Purpose

To authorize users and provide them with the means to start streaming a video.

#### 6.2.2 Responsibilities

- Receive a request from a client for a specific video.
- Authenticate the user.
- Check if the user is authorized to view the video (e.g., based on subscription status or geographic restrictions).
- Query the Metadata DB to find the path to the video's manifest file.
- Generate and return a short-lived, signed URL for the manifest file in the CDN.

#### 6.2.3 Dependencies

- Metadata DB, CDN.

---

## 7. Data Design

### 7.1 Data Models

- **Video**: `video_id`, `title`, `description`, `uploader_id`, `status` (uploading, processing, ready), `manifest_path`.
- **Transcoding Job**: `job_id`, `video_id`, `resolution`, `status`, `worker_id`.

### 7.2 Database Design

**Table: `videos` (PostgreSQL)**

- `video_id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `title` (TEXT)
- `description` (TEXT)
- `status` (VARCHAR)
- `s3_manifest_key` (VARCHAR)
- `uploaded_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- `processed_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)

**Object Storage (S3)**.

- **Raw Bucket**: `s3://streaming-raw-videos/{upload_id}/{original_filename}`
- **Processed Bucket**: `s3://streaming-processed-videos/{video_id}/hls/{resolution}.m3u8`, `s3://streaming-processed-videos/{video_id}/hls/{resolution}_{segment_id}.ts`

---

## 8. API Design

### 8.1 API Architecture

- A REST API for video management (upload, metadata) and a separate endpoint for retrieving streaming URLs.

### 8.2 Core APIs (RESTful)

- `POST /api/v1/videos/upload`: Initiates an upload and returns a pre-signed URL for the client to upload the raw video file directly to the Raw Video S3 bucket.
- `POST /api/v1/videos`: After upload is complete, client calls this endpoint with metadata (title, description).
- `GET /api/v1/videos/{video_id}/stream`: The main playback endpoint. Returns the signed CDN URL for the video manifest.

---

## 9. Security Design

### 9.1 Security Architecture

The architecture uses pre-signed URLs to provide time-limited access to resources, which is a key security pattern for services that use a public cloud object store.

### 9.2 Authentication & Authorization

- **Uploads**: The API endpoint that provides a pre-signed S3 URL for uploading will be authenticated to ensure only registered users can upload content.
- **Streaming**: The Streaming Service endpoint that provides the manifest URL will be authenticated. This allows for checks like "Is this user a subscriber?" or "Is this content available in the user's region?".

### 9.3 Content Protection

- **Signed URLs**: Both the manifest file and the individual video segments on the CDN will be protected by signed URLs with short expiry times (e.g., a few minutes). The video player client will need to be intelligent enough to refresh the URL if the session is long.
- **DRM (Digital Rights Management)**: For premium content, DRM technology can be integrated. The transcoding pipeline would encrypt the video segments, and the Streaming Service would provide a license key to authorized clients to decrypt and play the content.

---

## 10. Scalability & Performance

### 10.1 Performance Requirements

- As defined in section 4.2.1. The key user-facing metrics are time-to-first-frame and the rebuffering rate.

### 10.2 Scalability Strategy

- **Processing Pipeline**: The use of a message queue and a pool of stateless workers (e.g., Lambda functions or a Kubernetes cluster with auto-scaling) allows the processing pipeline to scale almost infinitely to handle upload bursts.
- **Metadata Service**: The database can be scaled with read replicas to handle a high volume of browse/search requests.
- **Streaming Delivery**: This is handled by the CDN, which is designed for massive global scale.

---

## 11. Deployment & Operations

### 11.1 CI/CD Pipeline

- A CI/CD pipeline will automate the deployment of all microservices.
- The video processing worker code will be packaged as a Docker container or a Lambda deployment package.

### 11.2 Monitoring & Alerting

- **Key Metrics**:
  - `upload_success_rate`
  - `processing_queue_length` (a key indicator of backlog)
  - `avg_processing_time_per_video`
  - `cdn_cache_hit_ratio`
  - `time_to_first_frame` (collected from client-side analytics)
  - `rebuffering_ratio` (collected from client-side analytics)
- **Tools**: A combination of cloud provider monitoring (CloudWatch) and application-level monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana).

---

## 12. Testing Strategy

### 12.1 Test Types

- **Pipeline E2E Test**: An automated test will upload a small, sample video file, poll the metadata API until the status is "ready", and then use a headless client to request the stream URL and verify that the manifest is valid.
- **Player Integration Testing**: Testing the video player on various devices and browsers to ensure it correctly handles the HLS/DASH manifests and can refresh signed URLs.
- **Load Testing**: Simulating thousands of concurrent clients requesting stream URLs from the Streaming Service.

## 13. Risk Analysis

### 13.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| High Transcoding Costs | High | High | Heavily optimize transcoding jobs. Use reserved instances or spot instances for processing workers to reduce compute costs. |
| "Poison Pill" Video | Medium | Medium | A malformed video file causes the processing worker to crash repeatedly. Implement dead-letter queues and alerts for jobs that fail multiple times. |
| CDN Outage | High | Low | A major CDN provider has a global outage. Implement a multi-CDN strategy, with a mechanism to fail over to a secondary CDN provider. |

### 13.2 Business Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Copyright Infringement | High | High | Implement a content identification system (similar to YouTube's Content ID) to detect and flag copyrighted material. Have a clear takedown policy. |
| High Bandwidth Costs | High | High | Negotiate favorable rates with CDN providers. Continuously optimize video encoding to reduce bitrates without sacrificing quality. |

---

## 14. Implementation Plan (High-Level)

- **Phase 1**: Set up the S3 buckets and the Metadata DB. Build the core upload and metadata services.
- **Phase 2**: Build the asynchronous processing pipeline using a message queue and FFmpeg workers. Start with a few standard resolutions.
- **Phase 3**: Build the Streaming Service to serve signed URLs.
- **Phase 4**: Integrate with a CDN.
- **Phase 5**: Develop and test a basic video player client.
