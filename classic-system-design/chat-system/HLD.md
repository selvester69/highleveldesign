## 2. Executive Summary

### 2.1 Purpose

This document provides the high-level design for a scalable, real-time Chat System, similar to services like WhatsApp or Slack. The system will support one-on-one and group chats, message history, and online presence indicators.

### 2.2 Scope

**In Scope:**

- Real-time one-on-one and group messaging.
- User presence status (online, offline, typing).
- Message history and synchronization across multiple devices.
- A stateful service to manage persistent connections.
- Push notifications for offline users.

**Out of Scope:**

- Voice and video calls.
- File and media sharing (initially).
- End-to-end encryption (E2EE). The design will focus on server-side logic, though it can be extended for E2EE.
- Advanced features like message reactions, threads, or bots.

### 2.3 Key Benefits

- **Real-Time**: Low-latency message delivery for a fluid conversational experience.
- **Scalability**: Designed to support millions of concurrent users and billions of messages per day.
- **Reliability**: Guarantees message delivery and maintains message order within a chat.
- **Cross-Platform**: The design allows for clients on multiple platforms (web, mobile) to connect and sync.

### 2.4 High-Level Architecture Overview

The architecture is centered around a stateful **Chat Service** that maintains persistent connections (likely via **WebSockets**) with online users. When a user sends a message, it is routed to the Chat Service, which then forwards it to the recipient(s) through their active connections. Messages are also persisted in a scalable NoSQL database. For offline users, a **Push Notification Service** is triggered. The system includes supporting microservices for user management, authentication, and message history retrieval.

## 5. Architecture Design

### 5.1 Architecture Principles

- **Stateful Services**: Unlike typical web services, the core chat service is stateful, managing persistent connections and user presence information in memory.
- **Real-Time First**: The design prioritizes extremely low-latency message delivery.
- **Resilience & Fault Tolerance**: The system must handle node failures in the stateful service without losing messages or dropping connections abruptly.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: While the core service is stateful, it must be designed to scale horizontally by adding more nodes and distributing users among them.

### 5.2 Architecture Patterns

- **Persistent Connections**: Clients maintain a persistent connection (WebSocket) to a chat server, enabling bidirectional, real-time communication.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: The system is broken into a stateful Chat Service and several stateless supporting services (User Service, Message Service, etc.).
- **Message Queues for Async Tasks**: Used for tasks that don't need to be synchronous, like sending push notifications or archiving messages.

### 5.4 Component Overview

- **Clients**: Mobile, web, or desktop applications that connect to the backend via WebSockets.
- **Load Balancer / API Gateway**: The entry point. For a chat system, this layer needs to be intelligent. It terminates the initial HTTP request for the WebSocket handshake and then routes the persistent connection to a specific Chat Server node. It must maintain a mapping of which user is connected to which server.
- **Chat Service Cluster**: A pool of stateful servers. Each server maintains active WebSocket connections for a subset of online users. When Server A receives a message for a user connected to Server C, it uses a service discovery mechanism to find and forward the message to Server C.
- **Service Discovery**: A mechanism (like ZooKeeper, Consul, or Redis) that allows chat servers to know which server is handling which user. When a user connects or disconnects, this registry is updated.
- **Message Service**: A stateless service responsible for persisting messages to the database and retrieving chat history.
- **Messages DB**: A scalable, high-throughput database (like Cassandra or ScyllaDB) optimized for time-series data. Messages are typically partitioned by `chat_id` (for a group or 1-on-1 chat) and clustered by time.
- **Push Notification Service**: For users who are offline, the Chat Service sends a message to this service, which then integrates with platform-specific push services like Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

### 5.5 Technology Stack

#### 5.5.1 Backend Technologies

- **Programming Language**: **Erlang/Elixir** (with OTP), **Go**, or **Java/Netty**.
  - **Justification**: These technologies are renowned for building highly concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems, which is exactly what a chat service requires. Erlang/Elixir is particularly famous for this (e.g., WhatsApp).
- **Real-Time Protocol**: **WebSockets**.
  - **Justification**: Provides a standard, full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, ideal for real-time chat.

#### 5.5.2 Database Technologies

- **Messages Database**: **Apache Cassandra**.
  - **Justification**: Excellent write throughput, linear scalability, and a data model that fits well with time-series chat messages.
- **User/Auth Database**: **PostgreSQL**.
  - **Justification**: A reliable choice for storing user profile data, which requires transactional integrity.
- **Service Discovery/Session Store**: **Apache ZooKeeper** or **Redis**.
  - **Justification**: To maintain the mapping of `user_id` to the `chat_server_ip` they are connected to.

### 5.6 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

#### 5.6.1 ADR-001: Communication Protocol

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: The system requires persistent, low-latency, bidirectional communication between the client and server.
- **Decision**: We will use **WebSockets** as the primary communication protocol. HTTP Long Polling can be supported as a fallback for clients behind restrictive firewalls.
- **Consequences**: WebSockets requires the load balancing layer and the chat service to be stateful, adding complexity compared to a standard stateless HTTP architecture. However, it is far more efficient than alternative real-time communication methods.

## 7. Data Design

### 7.1 Data Architecture

The data architecture is split between a highly available database for user metadata, a time-series optimized database for message data, and a fast in-memory store for session management.

### 7.2 Data Models

#### 7.2.1 Logical Data Model

- **User**: `user_id`, `username`, `profile_info`.
- **Chat**: `chat_id`, `type` (one-on-one, group), `participants`.
- **Message**: `message_id`, `chat_id`, `sender_id`, `content`, `timestamp`.
- **Session**: `user_id`, `server_id`, `session_status`.

### 7.3 Database Design

#### 7.3.1 Database Schema (Illustrative)

**Table: `messages` (Cassandra)**

- `chat_id` (UUID, Partition Key): ID for the 1-on-1 or group chat.
- `message_id` (TIMEUUID, Clustering Key): A time-based UUID that ensures chronological ordering and uniqueness.
- `sender_id` (BIGINT)
- `content` (TEXT)
- `metadata` (MAP)

**Table: `chat_participants` (Cassandra)**

- `user_id` (BIGINT, Partition Key)
- `chat_id` (UUID, Clustering Key): All chats a user is in.
- `chat_type` (TEXT)
- `joined_at` (TIMESTAMP)

**Data Structure: `sessions` (Redis/ZooKeeper)**

- **Key**: `user:{user_id}`
- **Value**: `{ "server_id": "chat-server-ip-5", "status": "online" }`

#### 7.3.2 Data Flow (Sending a Message)

1. A **Client** sends a `send_message` event over its WebSocket to its connected **Chat Server**.
2. The **Chat Server** sends the message to the **Message Service** to be persisted in Cassandra.
3. The **Chat Server** determines the recipients. For each recipient, it queries the **Session Store** (Redis) to find which Chat Server they are connected to (if any).
4. For online recipients, the server forwards the message to the appropriate peer **Chat Server(s)**, which then deliver the message to their connected clients over WebSockets.
5. For offline recipients, the server sends a request to the **Push Notification Service**.

## 8. API Design

### 8.1 API Architecture

The primary API is not RESTful HTTP but a message-based API over WebSockets. A few standard HTTP endpoints are used for session initiation and history retrieval.

### 8.2 WebSocket API (Events)

The WebSocket connection will handle various event types.

#### 8.2.1 Client-to-Server Events

- `send_message`:
  - **Payload**: `{ "chat_id": "...", "content": "Hello!" }`
  - **Purpose**: To send a message to a chat.
- `start_typing`:
  - **Payload**: `{ "chat_id": "..." }`
  - **Purpose**: To notify other users in the chat that the user is typing.
- `stop_typing`:
  - **Payload**: `{ "chat_id": "..." }`

#### 8.2.2 Server-to-Client Events

- `new_message`:
  - **Payload**: The full message object (`message_id`, `chat_id`, `sender_id`, `content`, `timestamp`).
  - **Purpose**: To deliver a new message to the client.
- `presence_update`:
  - **Payload**: `{ "user_id": "...", "status": "online" }`
  - **Purpose**: To notify the client that a user's presence has changed.
- `typing_indicator`:
  - **Payload**: `{ "chat_id": "...", "user_id": "..." }`
  - **Purpose**: To show that another user is typing.
- `error`:
  - **Payload**: `{ "code": 4001, "message": "Invalid chat_id" }`

### 8.3 REST API (Stateless)

- `POST /api/v1/chats`: Create a new group chat.
- `GET /api/v1/chats/{chat_id}/messages`: Get a paginated history of messages for a chat.

---

## 9. Security Design

### 9.1 Security Architecture

- The architecture uses a trusted subsystem model. The core Chat Service is protected within a private network, and only the API Gateway is exposed to the public internet.

### 9.2 Authentication & Authorization

- **Connection Authentication**: The initial WebSocket handshake will be an authenticated HTTP request, which is then "upgraded" to a WebSocket. This ensures only valid users can establish a connection.
- **Message Authorization**: The Chat Service will verify that a sender is a legitimate member of a chat before persisting or forwarding a message.

### 9.3 Data Security

- **Encryption in Transit**: All communication (HTTP and WebSocket) will be over TLS (WSS for WebSockets).
- **Encryption at Rest**: All persisted messages and user data will be encrypted at rest.

---

## 10. Scalability & Performance

### 10.1 Performance Requirements

- As defined in section 4.2.1. The key metrics are message delivery latency and the number of concurrent connections supported.

### 10.2 Scalability Strategy

- **Chat Service Scaling**: This stateful service is the most challenging to scale. It will be scaled horizontally by adding more nodes. A consistent hashing ring can be used to map `user_id`s to specific chat servers. When a node is added or removed, only a fraction of users needs to be re-routed.
- **Stateless Service Scaling**: All other services (User, Message, Push) are stateless and can be easily scaled horizontally behind a load balancer.
- **Database Scaling**: Cassandra is chosen for the messages DB specifically for its linear scalability.

### 10.3 Caching Strategy

- **Session Store**: A distributed cache (Redis) is critical for storing the `user_id` -> `chat_server` mapping. This must be fast and highly available.
- **Chat History Cache**: The most recent messages for active chats can be cached in Redis by the Message Service to reduce load on Cassandra for frequent history requests.

---

## 11. Deployment & Operations

### 11.1 Deployment Architecture

- The Chat Service cluster will be deployed on dedicated nodes (or a Kubernetes StatefulSet) to manage its stateful nature.
- Stateless services will be deployed as standard Kubernetes deployments.

### 11.2 Monitoring & Alerting

- **Key Metrics**:
  - `concurrent_websocket_connections`
  - `messages_per_second` (incoming and outgoing)
  - `p99_message_delivery_latency`
  - `session_store_hit_ratio`
  - `push_notification_queue_length`
- **Dashboards & Alerting**: Prometheus/Grafana and PagerDuty for alerting on anomalies in the key metrics.

---

## 12. Testing Strategy

### 12.1 Test Types

- **Load Testing**: This is critical for a chat system. Tools like `k6` (with its WebSocket support) or `Tsung` will be used to simulate tens of thousands of concurrent clients connecting, sending messages, and receiving messages.
- **Fault Tolerance Testing**: Chaos testing will be used to verify that the system handles Chat Server node failures correctly (e.g., clients are reconnected to a new node, and messages are not lost).

## 13. Risk Analysis

### 13.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Message "Split Brain" | High | Medium | In a network partition, two servers think they are responsible for the same user. Use a strong consensus mechanism like Raft or rely on a consistent store like ZooKeeper for leader election / node ownership. |
| Message Ordering Issues | High | Medium | Use a database that supports strict ordering (like Cassandra with TIMEUUIDs). Ensure clients have logic to re-order messages if they arrive out of sequence due to network conditions. |
| "Hot" Group Chats | Medium | Medium | A single group chat with thousands of active users can overload a chat server. Isolate these large groups to dedicated servers or implement server-side message batching. |

### 13.2 Operational Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Push Notification Service Failure | Medium | High | The 3rd party services (APNS, FCM) can fail. Implement robust retry logic and circuit breakers when talking to these external services. |
| Cascading Failure | High | Low | A failure in one service (e.g., Session Store) causes all Chat Servers to fail. Implement bulkheads and circuit breakers between all services. |

---

## 14. Implementation Plan (High-Level)

- **Phase 1**: Build the stateless User and Message services with their databases.
- **Phase 2**: Implement a single-node Chat Server and a client library to establish a WebSocket connection and send/receive messages.
- **Phase 3**: Implement the distributed, multi-node Chat Service, including the Service Discovery and session management layer.
- **Phase 4**: Integrate the Push Notification service.
- **Phase 5**: Conduct extensive load testing and fault tolerance testing.

---

## 15. Appendices

### Appendix A: Glossary

- **WebSocket**: A communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
- **Stateful Service**: A service that keeps track of client-specific data (state) in memory across multiple requests.
- **Presence**: Information about a user's status in the chat system (e.g., online, offline, typing).
- **TIMEUUID**: A version 1 UUID that is based on the current timestamp and the MAC address of the generating node. It is useful for time-series data where chronological sorting is important.
