## 2. Executive Summary

### 2.1 Purpose

This document provides the high-level design for a scalable and reliable Email Service, similar to Gmail or Outlook. The system is designed to handle sending, receiving, and storing emails for millions of users, interacting with other email services on the internet.

### 2.2 Scope

**In Scope:**

- Sending and receiving emails via standard protocols (SMTP).
- Storing user emails and organizing them into mailboxes.
- Allowing users to access their email via standard protocols (IMAP/POP3) and a web interface.
- Spam filtering and virus scanning for incoming emails.
- A searchable index of user emails.

**Out of Scope:**

- Advanced features like calendars, contacts management, or tasks.
- Complex, AI-driven email categorization (e.g., Primary, Social, Promotions).
- Collaborative features like Google Docs integration.
- End-to-end encryption.

### 2.3 Key Benefits

- **Reliability**: Designed for high availability and durable storage to ensure no emails are lost.
- **Interoperability**: Built on standard internet protocols (SMTP, IMAP) to communicate with any other email service.
- **Security**: Includes essential security features like spam and virus protection.
- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to scale to support millions of mailboxes and a high volume of email traffic.

### 2.4 High-Level Architecture Overview

The Email Service architecture consists of several key components that handle the flow of email. For incoming mail, **MX (Mail Exchange) Servers** receive emails from the internet via **SMTP**. These emails are passed through a **Filtering Service** (for spam and viruses) before being delivered to a **Storage Service** that manages user mailboxes. For outgoing mail, a user's client submits the email to a **Submission Server**, which then routes it to the appropriate destination MX server on the internet. A separate set of **Access Servers** provide **IMAP/POP3** and web access for users to manage their mailboxes. A search index is built on top of the stored emails to provide fast search capabilities.

## 3. System Overview

### 3.1 Business Context

Email is one of the oldest and most critical forms of digital communication, serving as the foundation for personal and business correspondence. An email service must be extremely reliable and secure, as users entrust it with sensitive information. It operates in a federated ecosystem, requiring adherence to decades-old internet standards.

### 3.2 System Purpose

The system's purpose is to provide a complete email solution, allowing users to send, receive, and store emails. It must handle standard email protocols (SMTP, IMAP, POP3) for interoperability and provide a modern web interface for user access.

### 3.3 Success Criteria

- **Uptime**: 99.99% availability for all services. Email is a critical service.
- **Durability**: Zero email loss. Emails must be stored durably and backed up.
- **Deliverability**: High success rate for delivering outgoing emails without being marked as spam.
- **Security**: Effective filtering of incoming spam and viruses.

### 3.4 Assumptions

- DNS records (MX, SPF, DKIM) for the service's domain are configured correctly.
- Users will access their email from a variety of clients (web, mobile, desktop).

### 3.5 Constraints

- Must be backward compatible with old email standards and clients.
- The system will be a constant target for spammers and phishing attacks.
- Data storage is significant, as users may store years of emails.

### 3.6 Dependencies

- DNS services.
- Third-party spam/virus filtering intelligence feeds.

---

## 5. Architecture Design

### 5.1 Architecture Principles

- **Standardization**: The system must strictly adhere to RFCs for email protocols (SMTP, IMAP, etc.) to ensure interoperability.
- **Security by Default**: All communication must be encrypted, and strong anti-spam/phishing measures are integral to the design.
- **Reliability & Durability**: The system is designed to never lose an email. All emails are persisted before acknowledgement.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The services for receiving mail (MTA), delivering to mailboxes (MDA), and accessing mail (IMAP/Web) are separate.

### 5.2 Architecture Patterns

- **Layered Architecture**: Email flows through distinct layers: edge servers (MX), filtering/processing layer, and storage layer.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: The system is composed of specialized services, each handling one part of the email lifecycle.

```

### 5.4 Component Overview

- **MX Servers (Mail Exchangers)**: The public-facing servers that receive email from other domains on the internet via SMTP (port 25). Their address is published in the domain's DNS MX records.
- **Filtering Service**: All incoming mail from MX servers is passed through this service. It performs spam checking (e.g., using SpamAssassin), virus scanning (e.g., using ClamAV), and checks against blocklists.
- **Mailbox Store & MDA (Mail Delivery Agent)**: The core storage system for all emails. The MDA is the component that takes a clean email from the filtering service and writes it to the correct user's mailbox in the store. This needs to be a highly durable and scalable storage system.
- **Submission Servers**: These servers listen on a different port (587) and are used by our own users to send outgoing email. Requiring authentication here is key to preventing our servers from becoming open relays.
- **Outbound Queue**: When a user submits an email, it's placed in an outbound queue. A separate process works through this queue, does the necessary DNS lookups for the recipient domains, and sends the email to the correct MX servers.
- **Access Servers (IMAP/POP3/Web)**: These servers provide the user-facing interfaces for reading and managing email. They authenticate users and talk to the Mailbox Store to retrieve email content.

### 5.5 Technology Stack

- **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)**: Open-source software like **Postfix** or **Exim** is the standard for building the MX and Submission servers.
- **Filtering**: **SpamAssassin** for spam scoring, **ClamAV** for virus scanning.
- **Mailbox Storage**: A distributed file system like **Ceph** or a custom application using a distributed database like **Cassandra** to store email data. User metadata and mailbox folder structure can be kept in a relational DB like **PostgreSQL**.
- **Access Servers**: Open-source IMAP servers like **Dovecot**. The web interface would be a standard web application (e.g., built with Go, Python, or Node.js).

### 5.6 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

#### 5.6.1 ADR-001: Email Storage Format

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: We need a standard, efficient, and durable way to store millions of individual emails.
- **Decision**: Each email will be stored as a separate object/file in a format like **Maildir**, which avoids file locking issues common with `mbox` format. The storage system itself will be a distributed object store or file system. A relational database will hold the metadata (From, To, Subject, Date, mailbox folder) and a pointer to the object containing the full email body and headers.
- **Consequences**: This separates the searchable metadata from the large blob data of the email itself. This allows the metadata database to be fast and efficient, while the blob data can be stored in a more cost-effective, high-durability object store. It also makes building a search index on the metadata straightforward.

## 6. Detailed Component Design

### 6.1 Component 1: MX Server

#### 6.1.1 Purpose

To be the public-facing gateway for receiving all incoming email.

#### 6.1.2 Responsibilities

- Listen on SMTP port 25.
- Accept connections from other mail servers.
- Perform initial checks (e.g., reverse DNS lookups, HELO verification).
- Pass the full email content to the Filtering Service.
- Acknowledge receipt of the email.

### 6.2 Component 2: Filtering Service

#### 6.2.1 Purpose

To protect users from spam, viruses, and phishing attacks.

#### 6.2.2 Responsibilities

- Receive an email from the MX server.
- Execute a pipeline of checks: antivirus scan, SPF/DKIM/DMARC validation, spam score calculation, blocklist checks.
- Based on the results, reject the email, deliver it to the user's spam folder, or deliver it to the inbox.
- Pass clean emails to the Mail Delivery Agent (MDA).

### 6.3 Component 3: Access Server (IMAP)

#### 6.3.1 Purpose

To allow email clients to connect and manage a user's mailbox.

#### 6.3.2 Responsibilities

- Listen on IMAP port 993 (secure).
- Authenticate users.
- Provide an interface to list folders, list message headers, and retrieve full messages.
- Handle message state changes (e.g., marking a message as read).
- Interact with the Mailbox Store to perform these actions.

---

## 7. Data Design

### 7.1 Data Models

- **Mailbox**: A collection of folders belonging to a user.
- **Folder**: A collection of messages (e.g., Inbox, Sent, Spam).
- **Message**: The core email object, including headers, body, and attachments. Metadata is stored separately from the raw content.

### 7.2 Database Design

- **Metadata DB (PostgreSQL)**:
  - `users` table: `user_id`, `username`, `password_hash`.
  - `messages` table: `message_id`, `user_id`, `folder_id`, `subject`, `from_address`, `to_address`, `received_at`, `is_read`, `storage_pointer`.
- **Blob Store (Ceph/S3)**:
  - The `storage_pointer` from the metadata DB points to an object here. The object is the full, raw RFC 822 formatted email.

---

## 8. API Design

### 8.1 API Architecture

- The "APIs" are the standard internet protocols themselves: SMTP and IMAP.
- A private, internal REST or gRPC API will exist for the webmail client to communicate with the Access Server logic.

### 8.2 Protocol-based Interaction

- **Receiving Email**: `Other Server -> SMTP -> MX Server -> Filtering -> MDA -> Mailbox Store`
- **Sending Email**: `User Client -> SMTP -> Submission Server -> Outbound Queue -> Other Server`
- **Reading Email**: `User Client -> IMAP -> Access Server -> Mailbox Store`

---

## 9. Security Design

### 9.1 Security Architecture

The architecture is a defense-in-depth model. The public-facing MX servers are hardened and isolated. The internal processing and storage layers are in a private network and not directly accessible from the internet.

### 9.2 Authentication & Authorization

- **SMTP Auth**: The Submission server will require SMTP AUTH for all users sending outbound mail.
- **IMAP/Web Auth**: The Access servers will use a standard username/password login, checked against the User database. All sessions will be over TLS.

### 9.3 Anti-Spam & Anti-Virus

- This is a critical component. The Filtering Service will use a multi-layered approach:
  - **Connection Filtering**: Rejecting connections from known malicious IPs (DNS blocklists).
  - **SPF, DKIM, DMARC**: Validating the authenticity of the sending domain.
  - **Content Analysis**: Using tools like SpamAssassin to score the content of the email itself based on heuristics.
  - **Antivirus Scanning**: Using tools like ClamAV to scan all attachments for malware.

---

## 10. Scalability & Performance

### 10.1 Performance Requirements

- As defined in section 4.2.1. The system must feel responsive for users managing their mail, and process the high volume of incoming/outgoing mail efficiently.

### 10.2 Scalability Strategy

- **Edge Servers (MX, Submission, Access)**: These are stateless and can be scaled horizontally behind load balancers.
- **Mailbox Store**: This is the hardest component to scale. It will be sharded by `user_id`. A mapping service will be required to direct the MDA and Access Servers to the correct shard for a given user. Each shard will consist of its own metadata DB and blob storage cluster.

---

## 11. Deployment & Operations

### 11.1 Deployment Architecture

- The system will be deployed across multiple data centers for high availability.
- Each data center will have a full stack of services. DNS will be used to direct traffic to the closest or healthiest data center.

### 11.2 Monitoring & Alerting

- **Key Metrics**: `inbound/outbound_mail_volume`, `mail_queue_lengths`, `avg_delivery_latency`, `spam_vs_ham_ratio`, `imap_command_latency`.
- **Alerting**: Critical alerts will be set for high mail queue lengths (indicating a delivery problem), high rates of rejected mail, or any service becoming unavailable. Monitoring of public email blocklists is also critical.

---

## 12. Testing Strategy

### 12.1 Test Types

- **Protocol Compliance Testing**: A suite of tests to ensure the SMTP and IMAP servers correctly implement the RFCs.
- **Interoperability Testing**: Regularly testing sending email to and receiving email from other major providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) to ensure compatibility.
- **Spam Filter Efficacy Testing**: Using a corpus of known spam (ham) emails to measure the false positive (false negative) rate of the filtering service.

## 13. Risk Analysis

### 13.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Storage Cluster Failure | High | Low | Replicate all data across multiple failure domains (racks, data centers). Implement and regularly test a robust backup and recovery plan. |
| Incorrect Spam Filtering | Medium | High | A legitimate email is marked as spam (false positive). This is a constant tuning battle. Provide users with a way to mark emails as "not spam" to feed back into the filter. |
| Mailbox Shard Imbalance | Medium | Medium | Some users have vastly more email than others, creating "hot shards". Design the sharding system to allow for splitting or moving users between shards. |

### 13.2 Operational Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| IP Blacklisting | High | High | One of the outbound IP addresses gets put on a public blocklist, preventing mail delivery. Carefully monitor outbound mail for spam. Use services to monitor blacklist status. Have a pool of IPs that can be rotated. |
| Open Relay Configuration | Critical | Low | A misconfiguration causes the Submission server to allow unauthenticated sending. This would be exploited by spammers almost immediately. Strict configuration management and testing are required. |

---

## 14. Implementation Plan (High-Level)

- **Phase 1**: Set up the core storage (Metadata DB and Blob Store).
- **Phase 2**: Implement the inbound mail flow: MX Server -> Filtering -> MDA -> Storage.
- **Phase 3**: Implement the user access flow: IMAP Server and a basic webmail client.
- **Phase 4**: Implement the outbound mail flow: Submission Server and Outbound Queue.
- **Phase 5**: Harden security, tune spam filters, and conduct interoperability testing.
