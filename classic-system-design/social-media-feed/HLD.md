## 2. Executive Summary

### 2.1 Purpose
This document outlines the high-level design for a scalable Social Media Feed system, similar to those used by platforms like Twitter or Facebook. The system will allow users to post content, follow other users, and view a personalized timeline of posts from the users they follow.

### 2.2 Scope
**In Scope:**
- User creation and profile management.
- Following and unfollowing other users.
- Creating posts (text-based initially).
- Generating a personalized, chronologically-sorted feed for users.
- A "fan-out" architecture for efficient feed delivery.

**Out of Scope:**
- Content ranking algorithms (e.g., "Top" or "For You" feeds). The feed will be purely chronological.
- Multimedia posts (images, videos) in the initial design.
- Direct messaging, groups, or events.
- Advanced features like stories, reels, or live streaming.

### 2.3 Key Benefits
- **Scalability**: Designed to support millions of users and high post/read volumes.
- **Performance**: Low latency for feed loading, providing a smooth user experience.
- **Reliability**: High availability for core functions like posting and feed viewing.
- **Flexibility**: The microservices-based architecture allows for independent development and scaling of features.

### 2.4 High-Level Architecture Overview
The architecture will be based on a microservices pattern with a "fan-out on write" strategy for feed generation. When a user posts, the system will proactively deliver that post to the feeds of all their followers. This pre-computation makes feed loading extremely fast for users. The system will use a combination of relational databases for user data, a wide-column NoSQL store for posts and feeds, and a graph database for managing the social graph (follow relationships). A caching layer will be used to further accelerate feed access.

## 3. System Overview

### 3.1 Business Context
Social media platforms are a cornerstone of modern digital communication. The core of these platforms is the feed, which provides a constantly updated stream of content from a user's network. The ability to deliver this feed quickly and reliably at a massive scale is a critical business requirement for user engagement and retention.

### 3.2 System Purpose
The system's purpose is to provide the core functionality of a social media service: allowing users to broadcast posts to their followers and consume a timeline of posts from users they follow. The design prioritizes low-latency feed retrieval and high scalability.

### 3.3 Success Criteria
- **Feed Load Time**: 99th percentile feed load time of < 200ms.
- **Post Propagation Time**: 95% of posts should be delivered to follower feeds within 5 seconds.
- **Scalability**: Support for 10 million daily active users, 50 million new posts per day, and an average of 5 billion feed views per day.
- **Availability**: 99.95% uptime for the feed service.

### 3.4 Assumptions
- The read-to-write ratio is very high (e.g., 1000:1). Users view feeds far more often than they post.
- The social graph has a power-law distribution: most users have a modest number of followers, while a few "celebrity" users have millions.
- Chronological ordering of the feed is acceptable for the initial version.
- Content is primarily text-based for this design phase.

### 3.5 Constraints
- The system must be designed to be cost-effective at scale, which influences choices around data storage and computation.
- Feed generation for users with millions of followers ("celebrities") cannot be allowed to impact the performance for regular users.

### 3.6 Dependencies
- Cloud Infrastructure Provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
- Potentially a 3rd party service for media storage (like S3) in the future.

## 4. Requirements Analysis

### 4.1 Functional Requirements
#### 4.1.1 Core Features
- **FR-001**: Users must be able to create an account and manage their profile.
- **FR-002**: Users must be able to follow and unfollow other users.
- **FR-003**: Users must be able to publish posts (containing text).
- **FR-004**: The system must generate a personal timeline for each user, consisting of a reverse-chronological list of posts from all users they follow.
- **FR-005**: Users must be able to view their own posts on their profile page.

#### 4.1.2 User Stories
- As a new user, I want to sign up and create a profile so I can participate in the platform.
- As a user, I want to find and follow other interesting users so I can see their posts.
- As a user, I want to post my thoughts so my followers can see them.
- As a user, I want to scroll through my timeline to see the latest posts from people I follow.

### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements
#### 4.2.1 Performance Requirements
- **Feed Read Latency**: < 200ms (p99).
- **Post Write Latency**: < 500ms (p99) for the initial write. Fan-out can be asynchronous.
- **Follow/Unfollow Latency**: < 1 second.

#### 4.2.2 Scalability Requirements
- The system must support a social graph of over 100 million users and 10 billion follow relationships.
- The system must scale to handle 1,000 new posts per second and 100,000 feed reads per second at peak.
- All components must be horizontally scalable.

#### 4.2.3 Availability Requirements
- **Read Path (Feed viewing)**: 99.95% uptime. This is the most critical path.
- **Write Path (Posting, Following)**: 99.9% uptime.
- **RTO**: < 10 minutes.
- **RPO**: < 30 minutes.

#### 4.2.4 Security Requirements
- User passwords must be securely hashed and salted.
- All inter-service communication must be encrypted.
- Protection against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
- Rate limiting on all API endpoints to prevent abuse.

#### 4.2.5 Usability Requirements
- The API should be intuitive for frontend developers to build client applications upon.

#### 4.2.6 Reliability Requirements
- Once a post is created, it should eventually appear in all followers' feeds (eventual consistency).
- Unfollowing a user must guarantee that their posts no longer appear in the feed.
- The system must be resilient to partial failures of its microservices.

---

## 5. Architecture Design

### 5.1 Architecture Principles
- **Read-Optimized**: The system is heavily optimized for fast, low-latency feed reads.
- **Resilience**: The system must be resilient to failures in individual components, especially during the fan-out process.
- **Scalability**: All components must scale horizontally to handle growth in users, posts, and relationships.
- **Asynchronicity**: Core operations like posting are decoupled from the heavyweight fan-out process using message queues.

### 5.2 Architecture Patterns
- **Microservices**: The system is decomposed into services like User Service, Post Service, Follow Service, and Feed Service.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Used for the fan-out process. A "new post" event triggers the fan-out workers.
- **Hybrid Fan-Out**: A combination of fan-out-on-write for regular users and fan-out-on-read for celebrity users to optimize performance and cost.

### 5.4 Component Overview
- **User Service**: Manages user profiles, authentication, and user-related data.
- **Follow Service**: Manages the social graph (who follows whom). It provides APIs to get the list of followers for a user.
- **Post Service**: Handles the creation, storage, and retrieval of individual posts. Posts are stored in a persistent database.
- **API Gateway**: The single entry point for all client requests. It routes requests to the appropriate backend services.
- **Message Queue**: A system like Kafka or RabbitMQ that decouples the Post Service from the Fan-out Service. When a new post is created, an event is published to the queue.
- **Fan-out Service**: Consumes "new post" events from the message queue. For each post, it retrieves the author's followers from the Follow Service. It then pushes the post ID into the feed data structure for each follower. This is the "fan-out-on-write" part.
- **User Feeds DB/Cache**: A highly available, in-memory data store (like a Redis Cluster) that stores the timeline for each user. This is typically a list of post IDs. For example, the key might be `feed:{user_id}` and the value is a Redis List or ZSET of `post_id`s.
- **Feed Service**: Provides the user's generated feed. When a user requests their feed, this service reads the list of post IDs from the User Feeds DB/Cache, retrieves the full post objects from the Post Service (a process called hydration), and returns the final feed.

### 5.5 Technology Stack
#### 5.5.1 Backend Technologies
- **Programming Language**: **Java/Kotlin with Spring Boot** or **Go**
  - **Justification**: These ecosystems offer robust frameworks, excellent performance, and strong support for building distributed, concurrent systems.
- **Framework**: Spring Boot (Java/Kotlin) or Gin (Go).

#### 5.5.2 Database Technologies
- **User/Follow Database**: **MySQL/PostgreSQL Cluster** or **Graph Database (Neo4j)**.
  - **Justification**: A relational database is suitable for user data. A graph database is a natural fit for the social graph and can handle complex "who follows whom" queries efficiently, but a relational DB can also work well initially.
- **Post Database**: **Cassandra** or **DynamoDB**.
  - **Justification**: Posts are write-heavy and can be partitioned by `post_id` or `author_id`. A NoSQL database is ideal for this scale.
- **Feed Cache/DB**: **Redis Cluster**.
  - **Justification**: Redis is perfect for storing user feeds in memory. Its data structures (Lists, ZSETs) are ideal for managing timelines, and its performance is critical for low-latency feed reads.

#### 5.5.3 Infrastructure & DevOps
- **Cloud Platform**: **AWS** or **GCP**.
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: **Docker** & **Kubernetes**.
- **CI/CD**: **Jenkins / GitLab CI**.

### 5.6 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
#### 5.6.1 ADR-001: Feed Generation Strategy
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: The system must serve feeds to millions of users with low latency. A simple "fan-out-on-read" (querying all followed users' posts at read time) would be too slow. A pure "fan-out-on-write" (pushing posts to all followers' feeds on write) would be too expensive for celebrity users.
- **Decision**: We will adopt a **hybrid feed generation strategy**.
  - For **regular users** (e.g., < 10,000 followers), we use **fan-out-on-write**. When they post, the Fan-out Service pushes the post ID to the Redis feed list of all their followers.
  - For **celebrity users** (e.g., >= 10,000 followers), we do **not** fan out their posts. Instead, we use **fan-out-on-read**. When a user loads their feed, the Feed Service first retrieves their regular feed from Redis, then separately queries for recent posts from any celebrities they follow, and merges the two lists in memory.
- **Consequences**: This adds complexity to the Feed Service (which must handle the merge logic) and the Fan-out Service (which must distinguish between user types). However, it provides a balance between read performance, write performance, and operational cost, which is critical for a system at this scale.

## 7. Data Design

### 7.1 Data Architecture
The data is segregated by function: user/social graph data in a relational or graph DB, post content in a NoSQL store, and feed structure in an in-memory cache.

### 7.2 Data Models
#### 7.2.1 Logical Data Model
- **User**: `user_id`, `username`, `hashed_password`, `profile_info`.
- **Post**: `post_id`, `author_id`, `content`, `created_at`.
- **Follow**: `follower_id`, `followed_id`, `timestamp`.
- **Feed**: A `user_id` is associated with an ordered list of `post_id`s.

### 7.3 Database Design
#### 7.3.1 Database Schema (Illustrative)
**Table: `users` (PostgreSQL)**
- `user_id` (BIGINT, Primary Key)
- `username` (VARCHAR, Unique)
- `password_hash` (VARCHAR)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)

**Table: `follows` (PostgreSQL)**
- `follower_id` (BIGINT, FK to `users`)
- `followed_id` (BIGINT, FK to `users`)
- Primary Key (`follower_id`, `followed_id`)

**Table: `posts` (Cassandra)**
- `post_id` (UUID, Partition Key)
- `author_id` (BIGINT)
- `content` (TEXT)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)

**Data Structure: `feeds` (Redis)**
- **Key**: `feed:{user_id}`
- **Type**: Redis ZSET (Sorted Set)
- **Score**: `timestamp` of the post (for chronological ordering).
- **Value**: `post_id`.
- **Example**: `ZADD feed:123 1679546891 "post_abc"`

#### 7.3.2 Data Storage Strategy
- **Social Graph**: Stored in PostgreSQL. For very large scale, this could be moved to a dedicated Graph DB like Neo4j.
- **Posts**: Stored in Cassandra, partitioned by `post_id` for fast lookups.
- **Feeds**: Stored in a Redis Cluster. Feeds are capped at a certain size (e.g., latest 1000 posts) to manage memory usage. Older posts are available on the author's profile page, which queries the Post database directly.

---

## 8. API Design

### 8.1 API Architecture
A RESTful API over HTTP. All requests and responses are in JSON format.

### 8.2 API Specifications
#### 8.2.1 Authentication & Authorization
- All endpoints (except login/register) require authentication.
- A stateless authentication mechanism like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be used. The token is passed in the `Authorization` header.

#### 8.2.2 Core APIs
##### API Endpoint 1: Create Post
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Path**: `/api/v1/posts`
- **Request Body**: `{"content": "This is my new post!"}`
- **Response (201 Created)**: The created post object.

##### API Endpoint 2: Get User Feed
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Path**: `/api/v1/feed`
- **Query Params**: `?page=1&limit=20`
- **Response (200 OK)**: A paginated list of post objects.
  ```json
  {
    "posts": [
      {"post_id": "...", "author": {...}, "content": "..."},
      ...
    ],
    "next_page_token": "..."
  }
  ```

##### API Endpoint 3: Follow User
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Path**: `/api/v1/users/{user_id}/follow`
- **Response (204 No Content)**

##### API Endpoint 4: Get User Profile
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Path**: `/api/v1/users/{user_id}`
- **Response (200 OK)**: User profile information and a paginated list of their posts.

## 9. Security Design

### 9.1 Security Architecture
A defense-in-depth approach is used, securing the application at multiple layers.

### 9.2 Authentication & Authorization
- **User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication. Users obtain a token via a login endpoint and present it for all subsequent requests.
- **Service Authentication**: mTLS will be used for all service-to-service communication.

### 9.3 Data Security
- **Data at Rest**: All databases (PostgreSQL, Cassandra) and caches (Redis) will have encryption at rest enabled.
- **Data in Transit**: All communication between clients and the API gateway, and between services, will be over TLS 1.2+.

### 9.4 Application Security
- **Password Security**: Passwords will be hashed using a strong, adaptive algorithm like bcrypt.
- **Input Validation**: All user-generated content will be sanitized to prevent XSS attacks. All SQL queries will use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
- **Rate Limiting**: Applied at the API gateway to protect against brute-force attacks and service abuse.

---

## 10. Scalability & Performance

### 10.1 Performance Requirements
- As defined in section 4.2.1. The key challenge is maintaining low read latency (<200ms) while handling a high write load and complex fan-out logic.

### 10.2 Scalability Strategy
- **Horizontal Scaling**: All microservices are stateless and can be scaled horizontally.
- **Database Scaling**:
  - **PostgreSQL**: Can be scaled using read replicas for read-heavy operations on user/follow data. For write scaling, sharding would be required at a very large scale.
  - **Cassandra/Redis**: Natively support horizontal scaling by adding more nodes to the cluster.
- **Fan-out Workers**: The number of Fan-out Service instances can be scaled up or down based on the length of the message queue.

### 10.3 Caching Strategy
- **Feed Cache**: User feeds (lists of post IDs) are stored in Redis. This is the primary cache.
- **Social Graph Cache**: Follower lists, especially for frequently posting users, can be cached in Redis to reduce load on the Follow Service/database during fan-out.
- **User/Post Cache**: A secondary cache (e.g., Memcached) can be used to cache full user profile and post objects to reduce load on the primary databases during feed hydration.

---

## 11. Deployment & Operations

### 11.1 CI/CD Pipeline
- A standard CI/CD pipeline will be implemented using Jenkins/GitLab CI.
- **Pipeline Steps**: Code Commit -> Automated Tests (Unit, Integration) -> Build Docker Image -> Deploy to Staging -> Automated E2E Tests -> Manual Approval -> Canary Deploy to Production.

### 11.2 Monitoring & Alerting
- **Metrics**: Prometheus will scrape metrics from all services (latency, error rates, queue lengths, cache hit ratio).
- **Dashboards**: Grafana will be used to visualize metrics.
- **Alerting**: Alertmanager will be configured to send critical alerts (e.g., p99 latency > 200ms, 5xx error rate > 1%) to an on-call rotation via PagerDuty.

### 11.3 Logging Strategy
- A centralized logging solution like the ELK Stack or Loki will be used.
- All logs will be structured (JSON format) to allow for easier searching and analysis.

---

## 12. Testing Strategy

### 12.1 Test Types
- **Unit Tests**: To test individual functions and classes in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: To test the interaction between a service and its database, or between two services.
- **E2E Tests**: To simulate real user scenarios from the API level.
- **Chaos Testing**: Using a tool like Chaos Monkey to inject failures (e.g., kill service instances, introduce network latency) into the staging environment to test system resilience.

## 13. Risk Analysis

### 13.1 Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| "Thundering Herd" for Fan-out | High | Medium | A celebrity posts, creating a massive fan-out job. Use message queue throttling and dedicated worker pools for large fan-out jobs. |
| Inconsistent Feeds | Medium | Medium | A user's feed is inconsistent across devices. Ensure proper cache invalidation. Use Redis transactions for atomic updates to feed lists. |
| Celebrity feed merge is slow | High | Medium | Heavily cache celebrity posts. The number of celebrities a user follows is likely small. Pre-compute and cache merged feeds for active users. |

### 13.2 Operational Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Redis memory exhaustion | High | Medium | Implement strict TTLs and size caps on all feed lists. Monitor memory usage closely and scale the Redis cluster proactively. |
| Message queue failure | High | High | Use a highly available, clustered message queue like Kafka. Implement dead-letter queues to handle messages that repeatedly fail processing. |

## 14. Implementation Plan (High-Level)

- **Phase 1**: Build core services (User, Post, Follow) and databases.
- **Phase 2**: Implement the basic "fan-out-on-write" pipeline with the Message Queue and Fan-out Service.
- **Phase 3**: Implement the Feed Service and the read path, including hydration.
- **Phase 4**: Implement the "celebrity" user logic (hybrid model) and advanced caching.
- **Phase 5**: Onboard monitoring, alerting, and conduct large-scale performance testing.
