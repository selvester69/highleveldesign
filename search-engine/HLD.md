## 2. Executive Summary

### 2.1 Purpose
This document provides the high-level design for a large-scale Search Engine, similar to Google or Elasticsearch. The system is designed to take the data collected by a web crawler, build a searchable index, and provide a low-latency query interface to find relevant documents.

### 2.2 Scope
**In Scope:**
- An **Indexing Service** that processes crawled documents.
- The creation and storage of a distributed **inverted index**.
- A **Query Service** that accepts search terms from users.
- A ranking mechanism to sort results by relevance.
- A distributed architecture capable of handling billions of documents and thousands of queries per second.

**Out of Scope:**
- The Web Crawler itself (this is a dependency, designed separately).
- Advanced query understanding (e.g., natural language processing, query expansion).
- Personalized search results.
- A user-facing web application (the focus is on the backend services).

### 2.3 Key Benefits
- **Performance**: Provides relevant search results with very low latency (sub-second).
- **Scalability**: The index is distributed and can scale horizontally to accommodate a growing number of documents.
- **Relevance**: The system is designed to rank documents based on relevance to the user's query.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The distributed nature of the index ensures that the failure of a node does not bring down the search service.

### 2.4 High-Level Architecture Overview
The Search Engine architecture follows the data flow from a **Web Crawler**. The **Indexing Service** consumes documents (web pages) from the crawler. For each document, it extracts words (terms) and builds a massive, distributed **inverted index**. This index maps each term to a list of documents that contain it. The index is sharded and replicated across many servers for scalability and fault tolerance. When a user issues a query, the **Query Service** receives it, identifies the relevant index shards, retrieves the document lists for the query terms, and performs a set operation (e.g., intersection) to find matching documents. A **Ranking Service** then scores these documents for relevance before returning the final, sorted list to the user.

## 3. System Overview

### 3.1 Business Context
Search engines are the primary gateway to information on the internet. Their business value lies in providing highly relevant results to user queries in fractions of a second, which can be monetized through advertising. A powerful search engine requires excellence in three areas: crawling (discovering content), indexing (understanding content), and querying (retrieving content).

### 3.2 System Purpose
This system's purpose is to index documents collected by a web crawler and provide a low-latency interface for searching them. The core of the system is the construction and querying of a distributed inverted index.

### 3.3 Success Criteria
- **Query Latency**: 99th percentile query latency of < 100ms.
- **Index Freshness**: New content from the crawler should be searchable within minutes.
- **Relevance**: The search results must be highly relevant to the user's query (often measured by metrics like NDCG).
- **Scalability**: The system must scale to index trillions of documents and handle tens of thousands of queries per second.

### 3.4 Assumptions
- A Web Crawler service exists and provides a stream of documents to be indexed.
- Documents have a unique ID and content.
- Basic text processing (e.g., tokenization, stemming) is sufficient for the initial version.

### 3.5 Constraints
- The inverted index is massive (petabytes) and must be stored and managed cost-effectively.
- Query processing must be extremely fast, requiring significant in-memory data structures.

### 3.6 Dependencies
- A Web Crawler service.
- A large-scale distributed file system (e.g., HDFS) or object store (S3) for the index.

## 4. Requirements Analysis

### 4.1 Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system must consume documents from the crawler.
- **FR-002**: The system must analyze document content, breaking it down into searchable terms (tokens).
- **FR-003**: The system must build and maintain an inverted index mapping terms to document IDs.
- **FR-004**: The system must provide an API to accept user search queries.
- **FR-005**: The system must return a ranked list of document IDs that match the query.
- **FR-006**: The system must support basic boolean operators in queries (AND, OR, NOT).

### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements
#### 4.2.1 Performance Requirements
- **Query Throughput**: Support 50,000 queries per second (QPS).
- **Query Latency**: p99 < 100ms.
- **Indexing Latency**: Time from document receipt to being searchable should be < 1 minute.

#### 4.2.2 Scalability Requirements
- The index must scale to trillions of documents.
- The query service must be able to scale horizontally to handle increasing QPS.
- The indexing service must scale to handle a high-volume stream of documents from the crawler.

#### 4.2.3 Availability Requirements
- The query path must be highly available (99.99%). A search engine being down has a massive impact.
- The indexing path can have slightly lower availability (99.9%).

#### 4.2.4 Security Requirements
- The query and indexing services must be protected from DoS attacks.
- If handling private data, access controls must be enforced at the document level.

## 5. Architecture Design

### 5.1 Architecture Principles
- **Sharding**: The index is too large for one machine, so it must be sharded (partitioned) across many nodes.
- **Replication**: Each shard is replicated on multiple machines for fault tolerance and higher query throughput.
- **Immutability**: The index files on disk are often immutable. Updates are handled by creating new index segments and periodically merging them.
- **Tiered Storage**: The index may be stored in tiers, with hotter data in memory or on SSDs and colder data on HDDs.

### 5.2 Architecture Patterns
- **Inverted Index**: The core data structure mapping terms to the documents that contain them.
- **Scatter-Gather**: A query is scattered to all relevant index shards, and the results are gathered and aggregated by a coordinating node before being returned to the user.

### 5.4 Component Overview
- **Indexing Service**: Consumes documents, performs linguistic analysis (tokenization, stemming, stop-word removal), and transforms them into a list of (term, document ID) pairs.
- **Index Builder**: Takes the output of the Indexing Service and builds the inverted index data structures. It creates small, immutable index "segments" and writes them to a distributed file system.
- **Distributed File System**: A durable store (like HDFS or S3) for the written index segments.
- **Index Serving Nodes**: A large cluster of nodes that host the searchable index. Each node downloads a subset of the index segments from the DFS, loads them into memory, and serves queries against them. The index is sharded across these nodes.
- **Query Service (or Query Broker)**: The public-facing service that accepts user queries. It broadcasts the query to all relevant Index Serving Nodes (scatter), gathers the results, merges and ranks them, and returns the final list to the user.

### 5.5 Technology Stack
- **Core Engine**: This is often a custom C++ application, but it can be built using open-source libraries like **Apache Lucene**.
- **Distributed System Framework**: Services can be built using standard frameworks in **Java**, **Go**, or **C++**.
- **Linguistic Analysis**: Libraries like **Snowball** for stemming.
- **Distributed File System**: **HDFS** or **Amazon S3**.

### 5.6 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
#### 5.6.1 ADR-001: Index Sharding Strategy
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: The index is too large for a single machine. We need a strategy to partition it across many nodes.
- **Decision**: We will use a **document-based sharding** strategy. When a new document arrives, it will be assigned to a shard based on a hash of its `document_id` (e.g., `shard_id = hash(doc_id) % num_shards`). The index for that document will only be built on its assigned shard. A query must therefore be sent to all shards to get complete results.
- **Consequences**: This approach is simple to implement and scales well for writes. The main drawback is that queries must be broadcast to every shard, which can be inefficient. An alternative is term-based sharding, which is more complex but can route queries to specific shards. For a general web search engine, document-based sharding is a common and robust choice.

## 6. Detailed Component Design

### 6.1 Component 1: Indexing Service
#### 6.1.1 Purpose
To process raw documents into searchable terms.
#### 6.1.2 Responsibilities
- Consume documents from the crawler.
- Apply text processing: tokenization, case normalization, stemming, stop-word removal.
- Emit a list of `(term, doc_id, position)` tuples.
#### 6.1.3 Internal Design
- A stateless, horizontally scalable service.

### 6.2 Component 2: Index Builder
#### 6.2.1 Purpose
To construct the inverted index segments.
#### 6.2.2 Responsibilities
- Consume the term-document pairs from the Indexing Service.
- Group pairs by term to create postings lists (`term -> [doc_id1, doc_id2, ...]`).
- Compress the postings lists.
- Periodically write out new, immutable index segments to the distributed file system.
- Trigger a merge process for smaller segments into larger ones in the background.

### 6.3 Component 3: Query Service
#### 6.3.1 Purpose
To orchestrate the execution of a user's search query.
#### 6.3.2 Responsibilities
- Parse the user's query string.
- Identify which terms to search for.
- Scatter the query to all Index Serving Nodes.
- Gather the top-k results from each shard.
- Merge the results and perform a final re-ranking.
- Fetch document snippets or titles for the top results to display to the user.

---

## 7. Data Design

### 7.1 Data Models
- **Inverted Index**: A dictionary-like structure where keys are terms and values are "postings lists".
- **Postings List**: For a given term, a list of `doc_id`s where the term appears. It can also contain positions and frequencies for ranking.
- **Document Store**: A simple key-value store mapping `doc_id` to the original document content or a snippet.

### 7.2 Database Design
- The primary "database" is the set of index segment files stored on a distributed file system like HDFS or S3.
- These files are highly compressed and optimized for fast scanning. Common formats include those used by Apache Lucene.
- A metadata database (like ZooKeeper or etcd) is used to keep track of which segments are active and where they are located.

---

## 8. API Design

### 8.1 API Architecture
- A simple REST API for the public-facing Query Service.

### 8.2 Core APIs (RESTful)
- `GET /api/v1/search?q=your+query+here`: The main search endpoint.
  - **Query Parameters**: `q` (the query string), `page` (for pagination).
  - **Response**: A JSON object containing a ranked list of search results, including document titles, snippets, and URLs.

---

## 9. Security Design

### 9.1 Security Architecture
The query and indexing services will be protected in a private network, with only the Query Service's public API exposed via an API Gateway.

### 9.2 Authentication & Authorization
- For a public web search engine, the query API is typically unauthenticated.
- For an enterprise search engine, the Query Service would need to enforce document-level access control, filtering results based on the user's permissions.

### 9.3 Application Security
- **DoS Protection**: The API Gateway will implement strict rate limiting on the query endpoint to prevent abuse.
- **Index Security**: The Indexing Service must be the only service with write access to the underlying index files in the distributed file system.

---

## 10. Scalability & Performance

### 10.1 Performance Requirements
- As defined in section 4.2.1. Query latency is the most important metric.

### 10.2 Scalability Strategy
- **Index Sharding**: As described in the ADR, the index is sharded by document. This allows the number of Index Serving Nodes to grow as the number of documents grows.
- **Query Service Scaling**: The Query Service is stateless and can be scaled horizontally.
- **Replication**: Each index shard will have multiple replicas. This allows for higher query throughput (reads can be served by any replica) and fault tolerance.

---

## 11. Deployment & Operations

### 11.1 Deployment Architecture
- Index Serving Nodes will be deployed on machines with large amounts of RAM and fast SSDs, as query performance is highly dependent on in-memory data.
- The Indexing Service and Index Builders can be run on less expensive, CPU-optimized machines.

### 11.2 Monitoring & Alerting
- **Key Metrics**: `p99_query_latency`, `queries_per_second`, `indexing_rate`, `index_size_on_disk`, `cache_hit_ratio` for any query-side caches.
- **Alerting**: Alerts will be set for high query latency, low indexing throughput, or if any index shard replica becomes unavailable.

---

## 12. Testing Strategy

### 12.1 Relevance Testing
- This is the most critical and unique testing requirement for a search engine.
- A "golden set" of queries and their expected top results will be curated by humans.
- Automated tests will run these queries against the engine and score the results using offline metrics like **NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)** and **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**.
- A/B testing will be used in production to compare different ranking algorithms based on live user engagement metrics (e.g., click-through rate).

### 12.2 Performance Testing
- Load testing will simulate high QPS to ensure the system meets its latency and throughput goals.

## 13. Risk Analysis

### 13.1 Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Poor Search Relevance | High | High | This is an existential risk. Invest heavily in the ranking algorithm. Use machine learning (Learning to Rank) and extensive A/B testing to continuously improve relevance. |
| Index Corruption | High | Low | The immutable segment-based design helps prevent this. Use checksums on all index files. Maintain backups of the index on the DFS. |
| High Query Latency | High | Medium | Ensure proper sharding and replication. Aggressively cache postings lists for common terms. Pre-compute and cache results for very common queries. |

### 13.2 Operational Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Storage Costs | High | High | Use advanced compression techniques on the inverted index. Use tiered storage to move older, less-frequently accessed parts of the index to cheaper storage. |
| "Hot Shard" Problem | Medium | Medium | A single shard becomes responsible for a disproportionate number of popular documents. This can be mitigated by better sharding strategies, but some level of imbalance is often unavoidable. Monitor shard load and over-provision resources. |
