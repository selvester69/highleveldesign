## 2. Executive Summary

### 2.1 Purpose

This document outlines the high-level design for a distributed caching system. The system is designed to provide a scalable, high-performance, in-memory data store that can be used to reduce latency and load on primary data sources. It is inspired by industry-standard systems like Redis and Memcached.

### 2.2 Scope

**Included**:

- In-memory key-value data storage.
- Distributed architecture with sharding for horizontal scalability.
- High availability through replication and failover mechanisms.
- Configurable data eviction policies.
- Simple client-server communication protocol.

**Excluded**:

- Complex query capabilities (e.g., SQL).
- Transactional guarantees beyond single-key operations.
- Disk-based persistence as the primary storage mechanism (though optional persistence is considered).

### 2.3 Key Benefits

- **Performance**: Drastically reduces data retrieval times by serving data from memory.
- **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable to handle growing data sets and request loads.
- **Availability**: Designed for high uptime with built-in fault tolerance.
- **Reduced Backend Load**: Shields primary databases and services from repetitive read requests.

### 2.4 High-Level Architecture Overview

The system employs a distributed, shared-nothing architecture where data is partitioned (sharded) across multiple nodes. A cluster management component handles node membership, data sharding, and failover. Clients connect to any node, and a routing mechanism directs requests to the correct node based on the key.

## 3. System Overview

### 3.1 Business Context

In modern application development, low-latency access to data is critical for providing a good user experience. Many applications repeatedly access the same data, putting significant strain on backend databases. A distributed cache addresses this by storing frequently accessed data in a fast, in-memory layer, improving application performance and scalability.

### 3.2 System Purpose

The primary purpose is to provide a fast, reliable, and scalable caching layer for applications. It will serve as an ephemeral data store for use cases such as session management, real-time analytics, leaderboards, and API response caching.

### 3.3 Success Criteria

- **Latency**: 99th percentile read/write latency of < 5ms for small objects (<10KB).
- **Throughput**: Support for at least 100,000 operations per second per node.
- **Availability**: Achieve 99.99% uptime.
- **Scalability**: Ability to scale the cluster linearly by adding new nodes with minimal performance impact.

### 3.4 Assumptions

- Clients are trusted within the network.
- Data stored in the cache is not the system of record and can be rebuilt from a primary data source.
- Network latency between nodes in the cluster is low (<1ms).

### 3.5 Constraints

- The system must operate primarily in-memory.
- The data model is limited to key-value pairs.
- Consistency is relaxed in favor of performance and availability (eventual consistency).

### 3.6 Dependencies

- A reliable network infrastructure.
- A cluster management system (e.g., ZooKeeper, or a built-in gossip protocol) for coordination.

### 5.4 Component Overview

- **Client Library**: Provides an easy-to-use API for applications to interact with the cache cluster.
- **Cache Proxy/Router**: An optional but recommended layer that abstracts the cluster topology from the client. It routes requests to the appropriate node.
- **Cache Node**: The core server component that stores a partition of the data in memory.
- **Cluster Manager**: A logical component (can be decentralized) that manages node membership, health checks, and shard allocation.

### 5.5 Technology Stack

#### 5.5.2 Backend Technologies

- **Programming Language**: C/C++ or Go for performance-critical path. Rust is also a strong candidate.
- **Framework**: Custom-built, lightweight framework focusing on network I/O.
- **Runtime**: Asynchronous, event-driven model (e.g., using epoll, kqueue, or io_uring).

### 5.6 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

#### 5.6.1 ADR-001: Sharding Strategy

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: We need a consistent way to map keys to cache nodes.
- **Decision**: Use Consistent Hashing. It minimizes data reshuffling when nodes are added or removed.
- **Consequences**: Provides good load distribution and simplifies dynamic scaling.

## 7. Data Design

### 7.1 Data Architecture

In-memory hash table is the core data structure. Data is partitioned across nodes using a consistent hashing algorithm.

### 7.2 Data Models

- **Key**: String or binary data up to a certain size limit (e.g., 256KB).
- **Value**: Can be simple strings, numbers, or complex serialized objects.

### 7.3 Database Design

- **Database Schema**: N/A (Key-Value model).
- **Data Storage Strategy**: Primarily RAM. Optional append-only file (AOF) or snapshotting for persistence and faster recovery after a restart.

### 7.4 Data Flow Diagrams

- **Write Operation**: Client -> Proxy -> Primary Node -> Replicas.
- **Read Operation**: Client -> Proxy -> Primary Node (or optionally, replicas for read scaling).

---

## 8. API Design

### 8.1 API Architecture

A simple command-based TCP protocol. Examples:

- `SET key value [TTL]`
- `GET key`
- `DEL key`

### 8.2 API Specifications

#### 8.2.1 Authentication & Authorization

- A simple `AUTH password` command as the first command after connection.

#### 8.2.2 Core APIs

- **`SET key value [EX seconds]`**: Store the key. `EX` specifies TTL.
- **`GET key`**: Retrieve the value for the key.
- **`DEL key`**: Delete the key.
- **`INCR key`**: Atomic increment for integer values.

---

## 9. Security Design

### 9.1 Security Architecture

The cache is assumed to operate in a trusted network environment. Security is not the primary focus but essential safeguards are provided.

### 9.2 Authentication & Authorization

- **User Authentication**: Shared secret (password) via the `AUTH` command.
- **Service Authentication**: N/A.

### 9.3 Data Security

- **Encryption in transit**: Support for TLS on client-server and server-server communication channels.
- **Encryption at rest**: Not supported by default, as data is ephemeral. Can be achieved at the disk level if persistence is used.

## 10. Scalability & Performance

### 10.1 Performance Requirements

- P99 latency < 5ms.
- High throughput via non-blocking I/O and efficient data structures.

### 10.2 Scalability Strategy

#### 10.2.1 Horizontal Scaling

- Add more nodes to the cluster.
- The consistent hashing ring is updated, and a small fraction of keys are redistributed to the new node.

#### 10.2.2 Vertical Scaling

- Increase RAM and CPU on existing nodes. Less desirable as it has physical limits.

### 10.3 Caching Strategy

This system *is* the caching strategy. Eviction policies like LRU, LFU, and FIFO are configurable.

## 11. Deployment & Operations

### 11.1 Deployment Architecture

Deployed as a cluster of nodes across multiple availability zones for high availability.

### 11.2 Environment Strategy

- **Production Environment**: A multi-node cluster with replication enabled.
- **Staging Environment**: A smaller-scale replica of the production setup.

### 11.3 CI/CD Pipeline

- Automated builds and unit/integration tests on every commit.
- Automated deployment of new versions to staging and production with canary releases.

### 11.4 Monitoring & Alerting

- **Application Monitoring**: Metrics like latency, throughput, cache hit/miss ratio, memory usage.
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: CPU, memory, network I/O of each node.

### 11.5 Logging Strategy

- Log important events like node startup, shutdown, errors, and membership changes.
- Avoid logging individual cache operations in production to maintain performance.

---

## 12. Testing Strategy

### 12.1 Testing Approach

- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components and data structures in isolation.
- **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between nodes, replication, and failover.
- **System Testing**: Test the cluster as a whole with simulated client load.
- **Performance Testing**: Use tools like `redis-benchmark` to measure latency and throughput under various loads.

## 13. Risk Analysis

### 13.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
